Conduct security review of type system changes to ensure no type confusion vulnerabilities are introduced.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Review all type changes for potential security implications
- Ensure optional types are properly validated before use
- Check for type confusion vulnerabilities in type guards
- Validate that security-critical operations maintain type safety
- Review API input validation with new type system

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Security review completed for all type system changes
- No type confusion vulnerabilities identified
- Optional types are properly validated in security-critical code
- Type guards don't introduce security bypass opportunities
- API input validation maintains security with new types

**Security Checks:**
- Type confusion vulnerability assessment
- Input validation security review
- Type guard security analysis
- API security validation
- Edge case security testing

**Testing Requirements:**
- Security test cases for type confusion scenarios
- Input validation security tests
- Type guard security tests
- API security validation tests
- Edge case security scenario testing
