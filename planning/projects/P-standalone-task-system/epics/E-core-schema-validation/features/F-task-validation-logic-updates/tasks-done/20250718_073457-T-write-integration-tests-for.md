Create integration tests that validate complete end-to-end validation workflows for both standalone and hierarchy-based tasks, ensuring the entire validation pipeline works correctly.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Write integration tests for complete standalone task validation workflows
- Write integration tests for complete hierarchy-based task validation workflows
- Test invalid parent reference detection in full context
- Test security validation integration with type detection
- Test error message generation in complete validation context
- Follow existing integration test patterns

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Integration tests cover complete validation workflows for both task types
- Tests validate that all validation components work together correctly
- Tests catch integration issues that unit tests might miss
- Tests run efficiently as part of the overall test suite
- Tests provide clear feedback on validation workflow failures

**Testing Requirements:**
- Integration tests for standalone task validation workflows
- Integration tests for hierarchy-based task validation workflows
- Tests for invalid parent reference detection in full context
- Tests for security validation integration
- Tests for error message generation in complete validation workflows

### Log


**2025-07-18T12:34:57.727836Z** - Successfully implemented comprehensive integration tests for complete validation workflows. Created 10 test functions covering standalone task validation, hierarchy task validation, security failures, circular dependency detection, mixed task types, contextual error messages, status transitions, and comprehensive integration scenarios. Fixed critical bugs in empty parent string handling, standalone task scanning, and task path resolution. All tests pass and quality checks are clean.
