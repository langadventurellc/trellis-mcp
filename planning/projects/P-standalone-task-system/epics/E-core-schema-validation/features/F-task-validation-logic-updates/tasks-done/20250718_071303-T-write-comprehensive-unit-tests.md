Create comprehensive unit tests for task type detection utility functions to ensure they correctly identify standalone vs hierarchy-based tasks in all scenarios.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Write unit tests for `is_standalone_task()` function
- Write unit tests for `is_hierarchy_task()` function  
- Test edge cases including None, empty dict, malformed data
- Test typical standalone and hierarchy task structures
- Follow existing test patterns and conventions
- Ensure good test coverage for all code paths

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All task type detection functions have comprehensive test coverage
- Edge cases are properly tested and handled
- Tests validate correct behavior for both task types
- Test suite runs efficiently without performance issues
- Tests follow existing testing patterns in the codebase

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests for both detection functions
- Tests for edge cases (None, empty dict, malformed data)
- Tests for typical standalone and hierarchy task structures
- Tests for boundary conditions and error scenarios
- Performance tests to ensure detection speed is adequate

### Log

**2025-07-18 - Task Implementation Complete**

Successfully implemented comprehensive unit tests for task type detection functions `is_standalone_task()` and `is_hierarchy_task()`. The implementation includes:

**Test Coverage Added:**
- 25 new test methods covering all edge cases and scenarios
- Edge cases: None, empty dict, malformed data, type mismatches
- Boundary conditions: Various parent field values, whitespace, special characters
- Performance testing: 2000+ function calls under 1 second
- Error handling: Non-dict inputs, circular references, nested structures
- Integration testing: Complementary behavior verification

**Test Categories:**
- Basic functionality tests (enhanced existing)
- Comprehensive edge cases for both functions
- Boundary conditions with various data types
- Malformed data handling (circular references, nested structures)
- Performance benchmarks with 1000+ tasks
- Original signature compatibility testing
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Integration scenarios verifying complementary behavior

**Files Modified:**
- `tests/unit/test_validation.py` - Added comprehensive test suite to TestTaskTypeDetection class
- All tests pass (900/900) with full quality gate compliance

**Key Achievements:**
- 100% test coverage for both task type detection functions
- All edge cases properly handled and tested
- Performance requirements met (<1s for 2000 calls)
- Quality gate compliance (flake8, black, pyright, pytest)
- Comprehensive documentation through descriptive test names

The task type detection functions now have robust test coverage ensuring they correctly identify standalone vs hierarchy-based tasks in all scenarios.
