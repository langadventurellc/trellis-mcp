Implement security validation to ensure standalone tasks don't introduce privilege escalation opportunities or allow validation bypass through manipulation of parent field presence.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Verify that standalone tasks maintain data integrity constraints
- Ensure validation bypass isn't possible through parent field manipulation
- Validate that standalone tasks don't introduce security vulnerabilities
- Maintain existing security boundaries for hierarchy-based tasks
- Follow security best practices for validation logic

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Standalone tasks cannot bypass security validation through parent field manipulation
- Data integrity constraints are maintained across both task types
- No privilege escalation opportunities are introduced
- Security validation performs efficiently without degrading system performance
- Validation logic maintains existing security boundaries

**Security Requirements:**
- Prevent manipulation of parent field to bypass validation
- Maintain data integrity across task types
- Ensure no privilege escalation through standalone task creation
- Validate that security constraints are preserved

**Testing Requirements:**
- Security tests for standalone task validation bypass attempts
- Tests for parent field manipulation scenarios
- Tests for data integrity constraint maintenance
- Tests for privilege escalation prevention

### Log

**Implementation Summary:**
Successfully implemented comprehensive security validation for standalone tasks to prevent privilege escalation and validation bypass attempts. The implementation includes:

1. **Security Validation Function (`validate_standalone_task_security`):**
   - Validates parent field for suspicious patterns (path traversal, injection attempts)
   - Detects privilege escalation attempts through forbidden fields 
   - Prevents validation bypass through parent field manipulation
   - Checks for control characters, excessive length, and whitespace-only values
   - Handles both standalone and hierarchy tasks appropriately

2. **Integration with Main Validation Pipeline:**
   - Integrated security validation into `validate_object_data` function
   - Applied to all task objects during creation and update operations
   - Maintains backward compatibility with existing validation logic
   - Provides clear, actionable error messages for security violations

3. **Security Patterns Detected:**
   - Path traversal attempts (`..`, absolute paths)
   - Injection attempts (control characters, null bytes)
   - Bypass attempts (null, none, undefined strings)
   - Privilege escalation fields (admin, root_access, etc.)
   - Malformed data (excessively long strings, whitespace-only values)

4. **Comprehensive Test Coverage:**
   - 28 test cases covering all security validation scenarios
   - Tests for false positive prevention (valid parent IDs)
   - Performance testing with large datasets
   - Integration testing with existing validation pipeline
   - Edge case testing for malformed and suspicious data

The implementation successfully prevents security vulnerabilities while maintaining data integrity and system performance. All existing tests continue to pass, ensuring no regression in functionality.
