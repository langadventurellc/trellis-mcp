Update core validation functions to conditionally validate parent references based on task type. Only hierarchy-based tasks should require valid parent references, while standalone tasks should skip parent validation entirely.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Modify existing validation functions to check task type before applying parent validation
- Use early return patterns for cleaner conditional logic
- Preserve existing parent validation logic for hierarchy-based tasks
- Ensure standalone tasks bypass parent validation completely
- Follow existing validation patterns and error handling conventions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Standalone tasks validate successfully without parent field validation
- Hierarchy-based tasks continue to require valid parent references
- Invalid parent references are properly detected and rejected for hierarchy tasks
- No performance degradation in validation speed
- Validation logic remains maintainable and testable

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests for standalone task validation scenarios
- Unit tests for hierarchy-based task validation scenarios  
- Unit tests for invalid parent reference detection
- Integration tests for complete validation workflows

### Log

**2025-07-18T16:23:30.000000Z** - Successfully implemented conditional validation logic for parent references in the `validate_object_data()` function. Added early return pattern to skip parent validation for standalone tasks while preserving existing validation for hierarchy-based tasks. Implementation uses existing `is_standalone_task()` function to detect task type and applies conditional logic at lines 1105-1113 in `src/trellis_mcp/validation.py`. Added comprehensive test coverage including 6 new test cases for standalone tasks (no parent, None parent, empty parent), hierarchy tasks (with valid/invalid parents), and ensuring other object types remain unaffected. All 828 unit tests pass and quality checks (flake8, black, pyright) are clean.
