Implement security validation to ensure standalone tasks don't introduce privilege escalation opportunities or allow validation bypass through manipulation of parent field presence.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Verify that standalone tasks maintain data integrity constraints
- Ensure validation bypass isn't possible through parent field manipulation
- Validate that standalone tasks don't introduce security vulnerabilities
- Maintain existing security boundaries for hierarchy-based tasks
- Follow security best practices for validation logic

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Standalone tasks cannot bypass security validation through parent field manipulation
- Data integrity constraints are maintained across both task types
- No privilege escalation opportunities are introduced
- Security validation performs efficiently without degrading system performance
- Validation logic maintains existing security boundaries

**Security Requirements:**
- Prevent manipulation of parent field to bypass validation
- Maintain data integrity across task types
- Ensure no privilege escalation through standalone task creation
- Validate that security constraints are preserved

**Testing Requirements:**
- Security tests for standalone task validation bypass attempts
- Tests for parent field manipulation scenarios
- Tests for data integrity constraint maintenance
- Tests for privilege escalation prevention
