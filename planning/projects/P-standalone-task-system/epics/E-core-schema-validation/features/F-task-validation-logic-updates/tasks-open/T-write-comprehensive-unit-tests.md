Create comprehensive unit tests for task type detection utility functions to ensure they correctly identify standalone vs hierarchy-based tasks in all scenarios.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Write unit tests for `is_standalone_task()` function
- Write unit tests for `is_hierarchy_task()` function  
- Test edge cases including None, empty dict, malformed data
- Test typical standalone and hierarchy task structures
- Follow existing test patterns and conventions
- Ensure good test coverage for all code paths

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All task type detection functions have comprehensive test coverage
- Edge cases are properly tested and handled
- Tests validate correct behavior for both task types
- Test suite runs efficiently without performance issues
- Tests follow existing testing patterns in the codebase

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests for both detection functions
- Tests for edge cases (None, empty dict, malformed data)
- Tests for typical standalone and hierarchy task structures
- Tests for boundary conditions and error scenarios
- Performance tests to ensure detection speed is adequate
