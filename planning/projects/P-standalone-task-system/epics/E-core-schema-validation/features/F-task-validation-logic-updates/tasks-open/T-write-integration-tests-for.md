Create integration tests that validate complete end-to-end validation workflows for both standalone and hierarchy-based tasks, ensuring the entire validation pipeline works correctly.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Write integration tests for complete standalone task validation workflows
- Write integration tests for complete hierarchy-based task validation workflows
- Test invalid parent reference detection in full context
- Test security validation integration with type detection
- Test error message generation in complete validation context
- Follow existing integration test patterns

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Integration tests cover complete validation workflows for both task types
- Tests validate that all validation components work together correctly
- Tests catch integration issues that unit tests might miss
- Tests run efficiently as part of the overall test suite
- Tests provide clear feedback on validation workflow failures

**Testing Requirements:**
- Integration tests for standalone task validation workflows
- Integration tests for hierarchy-based task validation workflows
- Tests for invalid parent reference detection in full context
- Tests for security validation integration
- Tests for error message generation in complete validation workflows
