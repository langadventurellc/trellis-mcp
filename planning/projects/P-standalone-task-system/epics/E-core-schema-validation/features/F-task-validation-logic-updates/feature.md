### Purpose and Functionality
Update the core validation logic to properly handle both standalone and hierarchy-based tasks, implementing different validation rules for each type while maintaining system consistency and data integrity.

### Key Components to Implement
- **Conditional Validation Logic**: Implement validation that branches based on task type (standalone vs hierarchy-based)
- **Parent Reference Validation**: Validate parent references only when parent field is present
- **Task Type Detection**: Create logic to determine if a task is standalone or hierarchy-based
- **Validation Rule Engine**: Update validation engine to apply appropriate rules based on task type

### Acceptance Criteria
- Standalone tasks validate successfully without parent field validation
- Hierarchy-based tasks continue to require valid parent references
- Invalid parent references are properly detected and rejected
- Validation performance remains consistent for both task types
- Clear distinction between validation paths for different task types

### Technical Requirements
- Modify validation functions to check for parent field presence before applying parent-specific validation
- Implement task type detection utility functions
- Update validation error messages to be contextually appropriate
- Ensure validation logic is testable and maintainable

### Dependencies on Other Features
- **F-base-schema-modification**: Schema must support optional parent fields before validation logic can be updated

### Implementation Guidance
- Create helper functions like `is_standalone_task()` and `is_hierarchy_task()` for type detection
- Use early return patterns in validation functions for cleaner conditional logic
- Follow existing validation patterns and error handling conventions
- Consider using strategy pattern for different validation approaches

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for standalone task validation scenarios
- Unit tests for hierarchy-based task validation scenarios
- Unit tests for invalid parent reference detection
- Integration tests for complete validation workflows
- Edge case tests for malformed task data
- Performance tests to ensure validation speed doesn't degrade

### Security Considerations
- Ensure validation bypass isn't possible through manipulation of parent field
- Validate that standalone tasks don't introduce privilege escalation opportunities
- Maintain data integrity constraints across both task types

### Performance Requirements
- Validation should complete in <10ms for typical task validation scenarios
- Memory usage should not increase significantly with conditional validation logic
- CPU overhead for type detection should be minimal
