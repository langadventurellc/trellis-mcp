Implement a system to collect and present multiple validation errors in a clear, organized manner instead of failing on the first error.

**Implementation Details:**
- Create ValidationErrorCollector class to aggregate multiple errors
- Implement error prioritization and sorting logic
- Support both summary and detailed error presentations
- Ensure error collection doesn't impact performance significantly
- Create utilities for error grouping and categorization

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Multiple validation errors are collected and presented clearly
- Error presentation includes both summary and detailed views
- Error prioritization works correctly (critical errors first)
- Performance impact is minimal for successful validation cases
- Error grouping is logical and user-friendly

**Dependencies:** Custom exception classes must be implemented first

### Log


**2025-07-18T16:17:20.390599Z** - Implemented comprehensive validation error aggregation system with ValidationErrorCollector class. The system provides error prioritization (Critical/High/Medium/Low), categorization (Schema/Field/Relationship/Security/Business/System), and both summary and detailed error presentations. Created enhanced validation functions that build on existing ValidationError base class while maintaining backward compatibility. Includes comprehensive test coverage with 32 test cases covering all functionality.
