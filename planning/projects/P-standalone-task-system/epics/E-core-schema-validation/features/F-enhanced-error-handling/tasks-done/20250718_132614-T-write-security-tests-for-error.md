Create comprehensive security tests for error handling to validate information disclosure prevention and timing consistency.

**Implementation Details:**
- Create test files in tests/security/test_error_security.py
- Test error message sanitization for sensitive information
- Test timing consistency across different error scenarios
- Test information disclosure prevention
- Test error handling security in adversarial scenarios
- Test error message filtering effectiveness

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Error message sanitization is thoroughly tested
- Timing consistency is validated across error scenarios
- Information disclosure prevention is tested comprehensively
- Adversarial security scenarios are covered
- Error message filtering is validated for effectiveness
- Security test coverage captures all security requirements

**Dependencies:** Security validation for error handling must be implemented first

### Log


**2025-07-18T18:26:14.423846Z** - Created comprehensive security tests for error handling in a dedicated test module focused on security aspects. The implementation includes 30 test cases covering error message sanitization, timing consistency, information disclosure prevention, adversarial scenarios, filtering effectiveness, security auditing integration, and boundary conditions. All tests validate the security properties of error handling including path redaction, database connection sanitization, environment variable filtering, IP address obfuscation, UUID redaction, stack trace removal, and timing attack prevention. The tests verify that the system maintains security while preserving functionality and handling edge cases robustly.
