Create integration tests for complete validation error workflows, testing end-to-end error handling from validation to client response.

**Implementation Details:**
- Create test files in tests/integration/test_error_workflows.py
- Test complete validation workflows for standalone tasks
- Test complete validation workflows for hierarchy tasks
- Test MCP tool error responses and serialization
- Test error handling in real-world scenarios
- Test error message consistency across all validation paths

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Complete validation error workflows are tested end-to-end
- Both standalone and hierarchy task validation workflows are covered
- MCP tool error responses are validated in integration tests
- Real-world error scenarios are tested comprehensively
- Error message consistency is validated across all paths
- Integration test coverage captures all major error scenarios

**Dependencies:** All validation updates and MCP tool handler updates must be complete

### Log


**2025-07-18T18:08:03.381866Z** - Successfully implemented comprehensive integration tests for enhanced validation workflows. Created test_error_workflows.py with 10 test cases covering error collector integration, MCP tool error responses, context preservation, complex validation scenarios, error message consistency, rollback mechanisms, and performance under load. All tests pass and integrate with the existing test suite.
