Create comprehensive unit tests for validation error aggregation system, including error collection, prioritization, and presentation.

**Implementation Details:**
- Create test files in tests/unit/test_error_aggregation.py
- Test error collection and aggregation logic
- Test error prioritization and sorting
- Test summary and detailed error presentation
- Test error grouping and categorization
- Test performance impact of error collection

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Error aggregation system has comprehensive unit tests
- Error collection and prioritization logic is thoroughly tested
- Error presentation formats are validated
- Error grouping and categorization is tested
- Performance impact is measured and validated
- Test coverage is >= 95% for error aggregation system

**Dependencies:** Validation error aggregation system must be implemented first
