Implement security validation for error handling to prevent information disclosure and maintain consistent error behavior.

**Implementation Details:**
- Create security validation functions for error messages
- Implement error message sanitization to prevent information leakage
- Add timing consistency for error responses to prevent timing attacks
- Create security audit functions for error handling
- Implement error message filtering for sensitive information

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Error messages don't leak sensitive information about system internals
- Error handling doesn't create information disclosure vulnerabilities
- Error behavior is consistent to prevent timing attacks
- Security validation functions are implemented and tested
- Error message sanitization works correctly for all scenarios

**Dependencies:** Error message templates system must be implemented first

### Log

Implemented comprehensive security validation for error handling to prevent information disclosure and maintain consistent error behavior. The implementation includes:

**Security Functions Added:**
- `sanitize_error_message()`: Removes sensitive information from error messages (file paths, database connections, IP addresses, tokens, UUIDs, environment variables, stack traces)
- `validate_error_message_safety()`: Validates error messages for potential security issues
- `filter_sensitive_information()`: Filters sensitive data from error context
- `audit_security_error()`: Logs security-related errors for monitoring
- `create_consistent_error_response()`: Ensures consistent timing and structure for error responses

**Error Collector Integration:**
- Enhanced `ValidationErrorCollector` with security validation options
- Added `add_security_error()` method for security-specific error handling
- Integrated sanitization and filtering into error collection process

**Comprehensive Test Coverage:**
- Added 37 new test cases covering all security validation functions
- Tests for sanitization, filtering, auditing, and integration
- Verified timing consistency and information disclosure prevention

**Security Measures:**
- Prevents information disclosure through sanitized error messages
- Maintains consistent timing to prevent timing attacks
- Filters sensitive information from error context
- Audits security-relevant error conditions
- Handles edge cases and attack vectors safely

All acceptance criteria have been met and the implementation has been thoroughly tested with 68 passing tests.


**2025-07-18T16:31:20.906551Z** - Implemented comprehensive security validation for error handling including message sanitization, information filtering, timing consistency, and security auditing. Added 37 new test cases ensuring all security measures work correctly.
