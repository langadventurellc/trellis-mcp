Create comprehensive unit tests for all custom exception classes, error codes, and serialization methods.

**Implementation Details:**
- Create test files in tests/unit/test_exceptions.py
- Test all exception classes and their initialization
- Test error code uniqueness and consistency
- Test serialization and deserialization of error objects
- Test error message generation and formatting
- Test context information handling

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All custom exception classes have comprehensive unit tests
- Error code uniqueness and consistency is tested
- Serialization methods are thoroughly tested
- Error message generation is tested for all scenarios
- Context information handling is validated
- Test coverage is >= 95% for exception classes

**Dependencies:** Custom exception classes must be implemented first

### Log


**2025-07-18T17:04:28.468860Z** - Implemented comprehensive unit tests for the three missing custom exception classes: InvalidStatusForCompletion, NoAvailableTask, and PrerequisitesNotComplete. Created 31 test cases covering basic functionality, exception behavior, message handling, inheritance, and real-world usage scenarios. All tests pass and quality checks are clean. The exception test suite now has complete coverage for all 8 custom exception classes in the system.
