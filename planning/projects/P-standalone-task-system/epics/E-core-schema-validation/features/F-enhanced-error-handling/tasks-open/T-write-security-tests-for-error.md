Create comprehensive security tests for error handling to validate information disclosure prevention and timing consistency.

**Implementation Details:**
- Create test files in tests/security/test_error_security.py
- Test error message sanitization for sensitive information
- Test timing consistency across different error scenarios
- Test information disclosure prevention
- Test error handling security in adversarial scenarios
- Test error message filtering effectiveness

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Error message sanitization is thoroughly tested
- Timing consistency is validated across error scenarios
- Information disclosure prevention is tested comprehensively
- Adversarial security scenarios are covered
- Error message filtering is validated for effectiveness
- Security test coverage captures all security requirements

**Dependencies:** Security validation for error handling must be implemented first
