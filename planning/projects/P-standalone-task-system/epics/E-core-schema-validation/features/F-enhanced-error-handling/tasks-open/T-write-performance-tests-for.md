Create performance tests to validate that error handling doesn't significantly impact validation performance and that memory usage is reasonable.

**Implementation Details:**
- Create test files in tests/performance/test_error_performance.py
- Test error message generation performance
- Test error aggregation performance with many errors
- Test memory usage for error objects
- Test validation performance with and without error handling
- Create performance benchmarks for error handling

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Error message generation performance is within acceptable limits
- Error aggregation doesn't significantly impact performance
- Memory usage for error objects is reasonable
- Validation performance impact is minimal for successful cases
- Performance benchmarks are established and validated
- Performance tests provide clear metrics and thresholds

**Dependencies:** Validation error aggregation system must be implemented first
