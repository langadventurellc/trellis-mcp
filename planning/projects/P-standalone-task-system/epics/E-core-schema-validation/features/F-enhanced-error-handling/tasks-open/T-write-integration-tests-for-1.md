Create integration tests for complete validation error workflows, testing end-to-end error handling from validation to client response.

**Implementation Details:**
- Create test files in tests/integration/test_error_workflows.py
- Test complete validation workflows for standalone tasks
- Test complete validation workflows for hierarchy tasks
- Test MCP tool error responses and serialization
- Test error handling in real-world scenarios
- Test error message consistency across all validation paths

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Complete validation error workflows are tested end-to-end
- Both standalone and hierarchy task validation workflows are covered
- MCP tool error responses are validated in integration tests
- Real-world error scenarios are tested comprehensively
- Error message consistency is validated across all paths
- Integration test coverage captures all major error scenarios

**Dependencies:** All validation updates and MCP tool handler updates must be complete
