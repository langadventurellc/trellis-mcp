Implement a system to collect and present multiple validation errors in a clear, organized manner instead of failing on the first error.

**Implementation Details:**
- Create ValidationErrorCollector class to aggregate multiple errors
- Implement error prioritization and sorting logic
- Support both summary and detailed error presentations
- Ensure error collection doesn't impact performance significantly
- Create utilities for error grouping and categorization

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Multiple validation errors are collected and presented clearly
- Error presentation includes both summary and detailed views
- Error prioritization works correctly (critical errors first)
- Performance impact is minimal for successful validation cases
- Error grouping is logical and user-friendly

**Dependencies:** Custom exception classes must be implemented first
