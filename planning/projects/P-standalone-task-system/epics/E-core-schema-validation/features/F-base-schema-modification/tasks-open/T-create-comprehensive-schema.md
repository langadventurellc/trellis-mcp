### Implementation Requirements
Create comprehensive unit tests covering both optional parent field scenarios and regression tests for existing hierarchy-based functionality.

### Test Coverage Areas
1. **Optional parent field tests**:
   - Schema validation with None parent field
   - Schema validation with empty string parent field  
   - Schema validation with omitted parent field
   - Serialization/deserialization with optional parent
   - Edge cases and error conditions

2. **Regression tests**:
   - Existing hierarchy-based task creation and validation
   - Parent field validation enforcement for hierarchy tasks
   - Schema operations with valid parent references
   - Performance validation (no degradation)

### Technical Approach
- Create test files following existing test patterns and conventions
- Write test cases for all validation scenarios (success and failure)
- Include serialization/deserialization roundtrip tests
- Add performance tests to ensure no degradation
- Follow existing naming and organization conventions

### Acceptance Criteria
- All optional parent field scenarios are thoroughly tested
- Test coverage includes success and failure cases
- Serialization/deserialization is comprehensively tested
- Regression tests confirm existing functionality works unchanged
- Tests follow existing conventions and provide clear error messages

### Security Considerations
- Include tests for security validation with optional parent fields
- Test that validation bypasses are not possible
- Verify all existing security validations remain effective
