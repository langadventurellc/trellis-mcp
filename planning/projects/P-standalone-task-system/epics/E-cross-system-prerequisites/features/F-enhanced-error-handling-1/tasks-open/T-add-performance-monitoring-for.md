### Implementation Requirements
Add performance monitoring and optimization for enhanced validation operations, ensuring the new cross-system error handling maintains acceptable performance characteristics.

### Technical Approach
- Extend existing benchmarking infrastructure in `validation/cycle_detection.py`
- Add timing measurements for prerequisite existence validation
- Monitor memory usage for enhanced error context
- Use existing performance measurement patterns

### Acceptance Criteria
- Performance monitoring shows validation overhead <10ms
- Memory usage for enhanced errors remains minimal
- Benchmark integration with existing performance tests
- Performance regression detection for validation operations

### Implementation Details
```python
# Performance monitoring integration:
@timed_operation("prerequisite_validation")
def validate_prerequisite_existence(...):
    # Implementation with timing
```

### Testing Requirements
- Performance benchmark tests for enhanced validation
- Memory usage measurement tests
- Regression tests for performance impact
- Load testing with large prerequisite networks

### Security Considerations
- Ensure performance monitoring doesn't log sensitive data
- Validate that timing information doesn't leak system details
- Use existing security patterns for performance logging
