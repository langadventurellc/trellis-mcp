### Purpose and Functionality
Enhance error handling and validation for cross-system prerequisite scenarios to provide clear, actionable error messages and robust validation of cross-system dependency references.

### Key Components to Implement
- **Cross-system reference validation**: Verify prerequisite IDs exist across both task systems
- **Enhanced cycle detection errors**: Clear error messages indicating which systems are involved in cycles
- **Missing prerequisite validation**: Validate that referenced prerequisites actually exist
- **Improved error context**: Error messages that specify task types and system boundaries
- **Validation during object creation**: Real-time validation of cross-system prerequisite references

### Acceptance Criteria
- All cross-system prerequisite references are validated for existence
- Cycle detection errors clearly indicate cross-system involvement
- Error messages provide actionable information for resolving issues
- Validation occurs at both creation and update time
- Performance impact of enhanced validation is minimal

### Technical Requirements
- Extend validation functions in `validation/` directory
- Enhance error messages in cycle detection algorithms
- Add prerequisite existence validation during object creation
- Improve error context in `ValidationError` exceptions
- Maintain existing validation performance characteristics

### Dependencies on Other Features
- None - can be implemented independently

### Implementation Guidance
- Extend `validate_acyclic_prerequisites()` with better error reporting
- Add `validate_prerequisite_existence()` function to check cross-system references
- Enhance `clean_prerequisite_id()` to validate ID existence
- Use existing `ValidationError` class with enhanced context
- Follow existing error handling patterns in `exceptions/` directory

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for each new validation function
- Integration tests for cross-system error scenarios
- Performance tests to ensure validation doesn't degrade performance
- User experience tests for error message clarity
- Edge case tests for malformed prerequisite references

### Security Considerations
- Ensure error messages don't expose internal file paths
- Validate that error context doesn't leak sensitive information
- Maintain path traversal protection during prerequisite validation
- Secure handling of invalid prerequisite ID formats

### Performance Requirements
- Prerequisite existence validation should add <10ms to object creation
- Enhanced error reporting should not impact cycle detection performance
- Memory usage for error context should be minimal
- Validation should scale linearly with number of prerequisites
