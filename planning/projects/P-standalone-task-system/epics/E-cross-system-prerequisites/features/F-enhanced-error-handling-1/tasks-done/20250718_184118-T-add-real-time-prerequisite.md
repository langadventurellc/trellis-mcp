### Implementation Requirements
Integrate cross-system prerequisite existence validation into MCP tool creation workflows, ensuring validation occurs at both object creation and update time with immediate feedback.

### Technical Approach
- Update `src/trellis_mcp/tools/create_object.py` to call prerequisite validation
- Modify `src/trellis_mcp/tools/update_object.py` for update-time validation
- Use the new `validate_prerequisite_existence()` function
- Maintain existing tool interface compatibility

### Acceptance Criteria
- createObject validates prerequisites before file creation
- updateObject validates prerequisites before applying changes
- Error responses use enhanced cross-system error messages
- Performance remains acceptable for typical MCP tool usage
- No breaking changes to existing tool APIs

### Implementation Details
```python
# Integration point in create_object tool:
if object_data.get('prerequisites'):
    validate_prerequisite_existence(
        object_data['prerequisites'], 
        project_root, 
        error_collector
    )
```

### Testing Requirements
- Integration tests for MCP tool validation
- End-to-end tests with invalid cross-system prerequisites
- Performance tests for tool responsiveness
- Error response format validation tests

### Security Considerations
- Validate that prerequisite validation doesn't bypass security checks
- Ensure error messages maintain existing security standards
- Use existing input sanitization patterns

### Log


**2025-07-18T23:41:18.897345Z** - Verified that real-time prerequisite validation is already fully implemented and integrated. The validate_prerequisite_existence() function in field_validation.py is properly integrated into both createObject and updateObject tools through the validate_object_data() pipeline. All existing tests pass (19 unit tests, 11 integration tests), confirming the validation works correctly for both creation and update operations with cross-system prerequisite checking and enhanced error messages. No implementation was needed as the feature was already complete.
