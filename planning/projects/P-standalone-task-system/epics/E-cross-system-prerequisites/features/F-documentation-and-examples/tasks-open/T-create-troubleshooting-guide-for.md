Create a comprehensive troubleshooting guide for common issues and error scenarios that developers encounter when working with cross-system dependencies.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Document common cross-system dependency errors and solutions
- Include diagnostic commands and debugging approaches
- Provide step-by-step resolution procedures
- Cover performance issues and optimization strategies
- Include prevention strategies for common problems

**Technical Approach:**
- Follow troubleshooting pattern from existing documentation
- Use actual error messages from enhanced error handling system
- Include diagnostic MCP commands for problem identification
- Provide copy-pasteable solution commands
- Reference examples and architecture documentation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Comprehensive coverage of common cross-system errors
- Clear diagnostic procedures for identifying issues
- Step-by-step resolution instructions with commands
- Performance troubleshooting and optimization guidance
- Prevention strategies and best practices
- Cross-references to relevant examples and documentation

**Error Categories to Cover:**
1. Circular dependency detection and resolution
2. Invalid cross-system prerequisite references
3. Performance issues with large dependency networks
4. Task type mismatches and validation errors
5. Standalone task path resolution problems
6. Prerequisite completion state conflicts
