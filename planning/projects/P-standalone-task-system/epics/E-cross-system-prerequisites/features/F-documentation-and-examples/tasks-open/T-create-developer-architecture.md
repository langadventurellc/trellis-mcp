Create comprehensive developer-focused architecture documentation explaining the technical implementation of cross-system prerequisites functionality.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Document the technical architecture of cross-system prerequisites
- Explain the unified dependency graph implementation
- Detail the enhanced error handling system
- Include Mermaid diagrams showing system interactions
- Document code patterns and design decisions

**Technical Approach:**
- Follow patterns from existing docs/PERFORMANCE.md
- Include detailed code examples from actual implementation
- Use Mermaid diagrams for visual architecture representation
- Reference specific modules and functions in codebase
- Explain performance optimization strategies

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Complete architecture overview with system components
- Detailed explanation of unified dependency validation
- Code examples from actual implementation
- Mermaid diagrams showing cross-system interactions
- Performance characteristics and optimization details
- Developer guide for extending cross-system functionality

**Content Sections:**
- Architecture Overview
- Component Interaction Diagrams
- Implementation Details (with code references)
- Performance Characteristics
- Extension Points for Developers
- Testing Strategy for Cross-System Features

**File Location:** `docs/cross-system-prerequisites/architecture.md`
