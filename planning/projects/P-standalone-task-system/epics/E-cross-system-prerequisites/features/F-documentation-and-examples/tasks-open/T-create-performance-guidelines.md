Create detailed performance guidelines and best practices for managing large mixed prerequisite networks efficiently in cross-system scenarios.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Document performance characteristics of cross-system prerequisites
- Provide specific recommendations for network size limits
- Include benchmarking guidance and performance testing approaches
- Detail optimization strategies for large dependency graphs
- Cover memory usage and processing time considerations

**Technical Approach:**
- Extend existing docs/PERFORMANCE.md patterns
- Include actual performance measurements and benchmarks
- Reference cycle detection optimization implementations
- Provide actionable recommendations with specific limits
- Include monitoring and profiling guidance

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Specific performance recommendations with measurable limits
- Benchmarking procedures for cross-system scenarios
- Optimization strategies for different network sizes
- Memory usage guidelines and monitoring approaches
- Performance testing procedures and tools
- Clear guidance on when to restructure dependencies

**Performance Aspects to Cover:**
1. Cross-system prerequisite validation performance
2. Memory usage patterns for mixed task networks
3. Cycle detection optimization in cross-system scenarios
4. Recommendation thresholds for network restructuring
5. Monitoring and profiling tools for performance analysis
6. Caching strategies for prerequisite validation
