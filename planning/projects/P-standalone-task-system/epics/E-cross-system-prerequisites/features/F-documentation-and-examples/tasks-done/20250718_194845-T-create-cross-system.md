Create the documentation directory structure and foundational files for cross-system prerequisites documentation in the docs/ folder.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Create `docs/cross-system-prerequisites/` directory structure
- Set up index file with navigation to all cross-system documentation
- Establish consistent documentation style and format
- Create placeholder files for all planned documentation sections

**Technical Approach:**
- Follow existing documentation patterns from docs/PERFORMANCE.md
- Use Markdown format with clear section hierarchies
- Include proper cross-references between documentation sections
- Set up documentation navigation structure

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Directory structure created with appropriate subdirectories
- Index file provides clear navigation to all sections
- Documentation style guide established and documented
- All placeholder files created with proper headers
- Structure supports both developer and user documentation needs

**Files to Create:**
- `docs/cross-system-prerequisites/index.md`
- `docs/cross-system-prerequisites/architecture.md`
- `docs/cross-system-prerequisites/examples/`
- `docs/cross-system-prerequisites/troubleshooting.md`
- `docs/cross-system-prerequisites/performance.md`

### Log


**2025-07-19T00:48:45.224507Z** - Created comprehensive cross-system prerequisites documentation structure with index, architecture, troubleshooting, performance, and examples directories. Documentation follows project conventions with clear navigation, technical depth, and practical guidance. All files include proper markdown formatting, cross-references, and maintain consistency with existing documentation patterns from PERFORMANCE.md. Structure supports both developer and user documentation needs as specified in requirements.
