Create comprehensive developer-focused architecture documentation explaining the technical implementation of cross-system prerequisites functionality.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Document the technical architecture of cross-system prerequisites
- Explain the unified dependency graph implementation
- Detail the enhanced error handling system
- Include Mermaid diagrams showing system interactions
- Document code patterns and design decisions

**Technical Approach:**
- Follow patterns from existing docs/PERFORMANCE.md
- Include detailed code examples from actual implementation
- Use Mermaid diagrams for visual architecture representation
- Reference specific modules and functions in codebase
- Explain performance optimization strategies

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Complete architecture overview with system components
- Detailed explanation of unified dependency validation
- Code examples from actual implementation
- Mermaid diagrams showing cross-system interactions
- Performance characteristics and optimization details
- Developer guide for extending cross-system functionality

**Content Sections:**
- Architecture Overview
- Component Interaction Diagrams
- Implementation Details (with code references)
- Performance Characteristics
- Extension Points for Developers
- Testing Strategy for Cross-System Features

**File Location:** `docs/cross-system-prerequisites/architecture.md`

### Log


**2025-07-19T01:04:22.275379Z** - Created comprehensive developer-focused architecture documentation for cross-system prerequisites functionality. Documented the technical implementation including unified dependency graph algorithms, enhanced error handling with specialized exception classes, cross-system validation logic, performance optimization strategies, and security measures. Included detailed code examples from actual implementation (field_validation.py:556-676, object_loader.py:16-69, graph_operations.py:18-50), Mermaid diagrams showing system architecture and cycle detection flow, and comprehensive developer guides for extending functionality. Documentation covers object discovery patterns, ID cleaning algorithms, task type detection, caching strategies, and testing approaches. All quality checks passed (formatting, linting, type checking, and 1574 unit tests).
