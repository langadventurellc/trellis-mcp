### Purpose and Functionality
Create comprehensive documentation and practical examples for cross-system prerequisites, enabling users to effectively leverage mixed task type dependencies in their workflows.

### Key Components to Implement
- **User guide documentation**: Clear explanation of cross-system prerequisite capabilities
- **Practical examples**: Real-world scenarios showing effective cross-system dependency patterns
- **Performance guidelines**: Best practices for large mixed prerequisite networks
- **Error troubleshooting guide**: Common issues and solutions for cross-system dependencies
- **API documentation updates**: Document cross-system behavior in MCP tool descriptions

### Acceptance Criteria
- Complete user guide covering all cross-system prerequisite features
- At least 5 practical examples of different cross-system dependency patterns
- Performance guidelines with specific recommendations and limits
- Troubleshooting guide covering common error scenarios
- All MCP tool documentation updated to reflect cross-system capabilities

### Technical Requirements
- Update documentation in `docs/` directory
- Add examples to appropriate documentation sections
- Update docstrings in relevant code modules
- Create sample project structures demonstrating cross-system patterns
- Ensure documentation is consistent with existing style and format

### Dependencies on Other Features
- **F-enhanced-error-handling-1**: Error examples need enhanced error messages

### Implementation Guidance
- Follow existing documentation patterns and style
- Use realistic examples that users would encounter
- Include both simple and complex cross-system scenarios
- Provide code snippets and command examples
- Cross-reference with existing Trellis MCP documentation

### Testing Requirements
- Documentation review for accuracy and completeness
- Example validation to ensure all provided examples work correctly
- Link validation for internal and external references
- User feedback incorporation if available
- Integration with existing documentation build process

### Security Considerations
- Ensure examples don't expose sensitive information or security vulnerabilities
- Validate that recommended patterns follow security best practices
- Review examples for potential misuse scenarios
- Ensure troubleshooting guides don't reveal internal system details

### Performance Requirements
- Documentation build time should remain reasonable
- Examples should demonstrate performance best practices
- Performance guidelines should be actionable and specific
- Documentation should be accessible and fast to navigate
