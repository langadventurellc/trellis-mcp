### Purpose and Functionality
Implement comprehensive integration tests specifically validating cross-system prerequisite scenarios that are currently missing from the test suite. Ensure all mixed task type dependency patterns work correctly through automated testing.

### Key Components to Implement
- **Cross-system dependency validation tests**: Test standalone tasks depending on hierarchical tasks and vice versa
- **Mixed dependency chain tests**: Complex prerequisite networks spanning both task systems
- **Cycle detection tests**: Cross-system circular dependency scenarios
- **Edge case testing**: Invalid references, missing prerequisites, complex prerequisite networks
- **Integration workflow tests**: Complete task lifecycle with cross-system dependencies

### Acceptance Criteria
- All cross-system prerequisite combinations have test coverage
- Complex mixed dependency scenarios are validated
- Edge cases and error conditions are properly tested
- Tests pass consistently with existing functionality
- Performance regression tests for mixed networks

### Technical Requirements
- Extend existing test framework in `tests/` directory
- Use pytest patterns consistent with current test structure
- Mock and fixture patterns for mixed task environments
- Integration tests that exercise full prerequisite validation flow
- Performance benchmarks for large mixed dependency networks

### Implementation Guidance
- Build on existing test patterns in `test_mixed_task_types.py`
- Add new test module `test_cross_system_prerequisites.py`
- Use existing fixtures for planning directory setup
- Follow existing assertion patterns for validation errors
- Implement test data generators for complex prerequisite networks

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for individual cross-system validation functions
- Integration tests for complete prerequisite workflows
- Edge case tests for invalid cross-system references
- Regression tests to ensure existing functionality remains intact

### Security Considerations
- Validate test environments don't expose security vulnerabilities
- Ensure test data doesn't contain sensitive information
- Test path traversal protection with cross-system references
- Validate error messages don't leak internal system details
