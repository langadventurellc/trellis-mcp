### Purpose
Create comprehensive integration tests for complex mixed dependency chains that span both hierarchical and standalone task systems.

### Implementation Requirements
- Test complex prerequisite networks spanning both task systems
- Validate complete task lifecycle workflows with cross-system dependencies
- Test task claiming scenarios with mixed prerequisites
- Ensure proper dependency resolution order across systems

### Test Scenarios to Cover
- **Multi-level dependency chains**: Hierarchical task → Standalone task → Hierarchical task
- **Complex prerequisite networks**: Multiple tasks with cross-system dependencies
- **Task claiming workflows**: Verify `claimNextTask` respects cross-system prerequisites
- **Task completion workflows**: Test `completeTask` with mixed dependency chains
- **Parallel dependency scenarios**: Multiple independent cross-system dependency chains

### Acceptance Criteria
- Complex mixed dependency scenarios are validated end-to-end
- Task lifecycle operations work correctly with cross-system dependencies
- All edge cases and error conditions are properly tested
- Tests integrate with existing task lifecycle test patterns

### Technical Approach
- Extend test patterns from the refactored mixed task lifecycle test module
- Use existing MCP server integration test infrastructure
- Create test data generators for complex dependency networks
- Follow existing async test patterns and fixture usage
- Implement comprehensive assertion patterns for dependency validation

### Log
**2025-07-19T03:14:38.058626Z** - Implemented comprehensive mixed dependency chain integration tests covering complex cross-system dependency scenarios. Created 7 comprehensive test cases that validate multi-level dependency chains, fan-out/fan-in networks, diamond dependency patterns, large-scale performance, concurrent operations, error recovery, and deep chain cycle detection. All tests validate cross-system dependency resolution between hierarchical and standalone task systems, ensuring proper task claiming workflows, completion cascades, and performance requirements. Tests cover edge cases including malicious input validation, circular dependency detection across systems, and concurrent operation safety. Performance optimizations verified with realistic timing expectations (500ms for complex operations).
