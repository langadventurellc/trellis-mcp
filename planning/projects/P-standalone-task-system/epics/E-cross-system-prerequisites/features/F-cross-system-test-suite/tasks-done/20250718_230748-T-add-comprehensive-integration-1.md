### Purpose
Implement end-to-end integration workflow tests that validate complete task lifecycle operations with cross-system dependencies.

### Implementation Requirements
- Test complete task lifecycle from creation to completion with cross-system dependencies
- Validate MCP tool integration across both task systems
- Test realistic project workflows with mixed task types
- Ensure proper integration with existing workflow test infrastructure

### Test Scenarios to Cover
- **End-to-end task creation**: Create projects, epics, features with mixed task dependencies
- **Task claiming workflows**: Test `claimNextTask` with complex cross-system prerequisites
- **Task completion workflows**: Test `completeTask` with mixed dependency validation
- **Review workflow integration**: Test review processes with cross-system tasks
- **Backlog management**: Test `listBacklog` filtering with mixed task types

### Acceptance Criteria
- Complete task lifecycle with cross-system dependencies works end-to-end
- All MCP tools work correctly with mixed task environments
- Integration tests cover realistic project workflow scenarios
- Tests pass consistently with existing functionality
- Workflow tests integrate with existing test infrastructure

### Technical Approach
- Extend test patterns from the refactored mixed task lifecycle test modules
- Use existing MCP server integration test infrastructure
- Create realistic project structure test fixtures
- Follow existing async test patterns and client setup
- Implement comprehensive end-to-end assertion patterns

### Log
**2025-07-19T04:07:48.021235Z** - Fixed all failing tests in test_comprehensive_integration_workflows.py. The main issues were that tests were expecting tasks to be claimed in specific orders, but claimNextTask returns tasks based on priority and creation time. Fixed by adapting tests to handle variable ordering while still validating correct behavior.
