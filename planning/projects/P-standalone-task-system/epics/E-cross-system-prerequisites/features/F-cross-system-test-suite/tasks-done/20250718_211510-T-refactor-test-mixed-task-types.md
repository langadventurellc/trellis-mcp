### Purpose
Refactor the large `test_mixed_task_types.py` file into multiple focused test modules to improve maintainability and organization before adding new cross-system tests.

### Implementation Requirements
- Split `test_mixed_task_types.py` into logical, focused test modules
- Maintain all existing test functionality and coverage
- Preserve existing test patterns and fixtures
- Ensure all refactored tests continue to pass
- Create clear module boundaries for different test categories

### Refactoring Strategy
- **Module 1: `test_mixed_task_path_resolution.py`** - Path resolution and priority tests
- **Module 2: `test_mixed_task_operations.py`** - Basic CRUD operations with mixed tasks
- **Module 3: `test_mixed_task_lifecycle.py`** - Task claiming, completion, and lifecycle workflows
- **Module 4: `test_mixed_task_validation.py`** - Validation and error handling tests

### Acceptance Criteria
- Original `test_mixed_task_types.py` is split into 4 focused modules
- All existing tests continue to pass without modification
- Test fixtures and patterns are properly shared via conftest.py
- Each new module has clear responsibility boundaries
- Test execution time and coverage remain equivalent
- Documentation updated to reflect new test organization

### Technical Approach
- Analyze existing test structure and identify logical groupings
- Extract shared fixtures to appropriate conftest.py files
- Maintain existing async test patterns and MCP client usage
- Preserve all test assertions and validation logic
- Update any test discovery or CI configuration as needed
- Follow existing test module naming and organization conventions

### Log


**2025-07-19T02:15:10.122989Z** - Successfully refactored the large test_mixed_task_types.py file (25,228 tokens) into 4 focused test modules, improving maintainability and organization. All 10 test functions preserved exactly with clear module boundaries for path resolution, operations, lifecycle, and validation concerns. All tests pass with maintained execution time and coverage.
