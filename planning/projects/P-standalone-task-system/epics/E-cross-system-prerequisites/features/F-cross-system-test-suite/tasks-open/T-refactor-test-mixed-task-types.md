### Purpose
Refactor the large `test_mixed_task_types.py` file into multiple focused test modules to improve maintainability and organization before adding new cross-system tests.

### Implementation Requirements
- Split `test_mixed_task_types.py` into logical, focused test modules
- Maintain all existing test functionality and coverage
- Preserve existing test patterns and fixtures
- Ensure all refactored tests continue to pass
- Create clear module boundaries for different test categories

### Refactoring Strategy
- **Module 1: `test_mixed_task_path_resolution.py`** - Path resolution and priority tests
- **Module 2: `test_mixed_task_operations.py`** - Basic CRUD operations with mixed tasks
- **Module 3: `test_mixed_task_lifecycle.py`** - Task claiming, completion, and lifecycle workflows
- **Module 4: `test_mixed_task_validation.py`** - Validation and error handling tests

### Acceptance Criteria
- Original `test_mixed_task_types.py` is split into 4 focused modules
- All existing tests continue to pass without modification
- Test fixtures and patterns are properly shared via conftest.py
- Each new module has clear responsibility boundaries
- Test execution time and coverage remain equivalent
- Documentation updated to reflect new test organization

### Technical Approach
- Analyze existing test structure and identify logical groupings
- Extract shared fixtures to appropriate conftest.py files
- Maintain existing async test patterns and MCP client usage
- Preserve all test assertions and validation logic
- Update any test discovery or CI configuration as needed
- Follow existing test module naming and organization conventions
