### Purpose
Implement end-to-end integration workflow tests that validate complete task lifecycle operations with cross-system dependencies.

### Implementation Requirements
- Test complete task lifecycle from creation to completion with cross-system dependencies
- Validate MCP tool integration across both task systems
- Test realistic project workflows with mixed task types
- Ensure proper integration with existing workflow test infrastructure

### Test Scenarios to Cover
- **End-to-end task creation**: Create projects, epics, features with mixed task dependencies
- **Task claiming workflows**: Test `claimNextTask` with complex cross-system prerequisites
- **Task completion workflows**: Test `completeTask` with mixed dependency validation
- **Review workflow integration**: Test review processes with cross-system tasks
- **Backlog management**: Test `listBacklog` filtering with mixed task types

### Acceptance Criteria
- Complete task lifecycle with cross-system dependencies works end-to-end
- All MCP tools work correctly with mixed task environments
- Integration tests cover realistic project workflow scenarios
- Tests pass consistently with existing functionality
- Workflow tests integrate with existing test infrastructure

### Technical Approach
- Extend test patterns from the refactored mixed task lifecycle test modules
- Use existing MCP server integration test infrastructure
- Create realistic project structure test fixtures
- Follow existing async test patterns and client setup
- Implement comprehensive end-to-end assertion patterns
