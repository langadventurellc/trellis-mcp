### Purpose and Functionality
Enhance the scanner functionality to discover standalone tasks alongside hierarchy-based tasks. This ensures all task discovery operations return complete results including both task storage patterns.

### Key Components to Implement
- Extend `scanner.py` to scan `planning/tasks/` directory
- Integrate standalone task discovery with existing scanning logic
- Maintain performance and efficiency of scanning operations
- Support filtering and sorting of mixed task types

### Acceptance Criteria
- Scanner discovers standalone tasks in all discovery operations
- Performance doesn't degrade with additional directory scanning
- Results include both hierarchy-based and standalone tasks
- Task metadata correctly identifies task type and location

### Technical Requirements
- Modify `TaskScanner` class to handle multiple scan locations
- Add standalone task directory traversal logic
- Integrate results from multiple scan sources
- Preserve existing scanner interface and behavior

### Dependencies on Other Features
- F-standalone-task-path-resolution: Requires path resolution for standalone tasks

### Implementation Guidance
- Study current scanner implementation patterns and performance characteristics
- Use parallel scanning strategies if beneficial for performance
- Implement proper error handling for missing directories
- Maintain consistent task metadata across both discovery methods

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for standalone task discovery
- Integration tests with mixed task environments
- Performance tests comparing scan times with/without standalone tasks
- Edge case testing for empty or missing standalone task directories

### Security Considerations
- Validate directory permissions before scanning
- Prevent scanning outside of designated task directories
- Handle symbolic links and special files appropriately

### Performance Requirements
- Total scan time should remain under 100ms for typical project structures
- Memory usage should not increase significantly with standalone task discovery
- Efficient filtering and sorting of combined results
