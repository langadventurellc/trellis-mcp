### Purpose and Functionality
Implement file organization patterns for standalone tasks including `tasks-open` and `tasks-done` directory structures. This enables proper task lifecycle management and status-based organization for standalone tasks.

### Key Components to Implement
- Create directory structure for task status organization
- Implement task file movement logic for status transitions
- Add support for both immediate and subdirectory organization patterns
- Ensure consistent file naming and organization across task types

### Acceptance Criteria
- Tasks are organized by status in appropriate directories
- Status transitions properly move task files between directories
- File naming patterns remain consistent (T-{task-id}.md)
- Directory structure supports future task status additions

### Technical Requirements
- Implement status-based directory mapping
- Add file movement operations for task status changes
- Create directories automatically when needed
- Handle file conflicts and error conditions gracefully

### Dependencies on Other Features
- F-standalone-task-path-resolution: Requires path resolution infrastructure

### Implementation Guidance
- Follow existing file organization patterns from hierarchy-based tasks
- Use atomic file operations to prevent data loss during transitions
- Implement proper error handling and rollback mechanisms
- Consider future task status types in directory structure design

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for directory creation and file organization
- Integration tests for task status transitions
- File system tests for various organization scenarios
- Error handling tests for file conflicts and permission issues

### Security Considerations
- Validate file paths to prevent directory traversal
- Ensure proper file permissions on created directories and files
- Handle concurrent access to task files safely

### Performance Requirements
- File organization operations should complete in < 10ms
- Directory creation should be efficient and not block other operations
- Status transitions should be atomic and reliable
