### Implementation Requirements
Review the current path_resolver.py implementation to understand existing patterns and identify the exact modification points for standalone task support.

### Technical Approach
- Examine the current `resolve_path_for_new_object` function (lines 135-291)
- Analyze the standalone task handling logic already present (lines 236-251)
- Review the `id_to_path` and `path_to_id` functions for modification points
- Identify where standalone task detection logic should be added

### Acceptance Criteria
- Document the current standalone task implementation (already partially implemented)
- Identify the specific functions that need modification for full standalone task support
- Create a modification plan for extending the existing logic
- Understand the current directory structure patterns for both hierarchy and standalone tasks

### Dependencies
- None (analysis task)

### Security Considerations
- Note existing input validation patterns
- Identify security measures already in place for path construction
- Document any security considerations for standalone task paths

### Testing Requirements
- Document existing test patterns for path resolution
- Identify test cases that need to be added for standalone tasks
- Note any edge cases in current implementation

### Files to Analyze
- src/trellis_mcp/path_resolver.py (primary focus)
- src/trellis_mcp/fs_utils.py (supporting utilities)
- Any existing test files for path resolution

### Analysis Results

#### Current Implementation Status: ✅ ALREADY IMPLEMENTED

**CRITICAL FINDING:** Standalone task support is **already fully implemented** in the current codebase. No core functionality modifications are needed.

#### Existing Standalone Task Support

**1. `resolve_path_for_new_object` (lines 236-251):**
- ✅ Handles standalone tasks when `parent_id` is None or empty
- ✅ Places tasks in `path_resolution_root/tasks-open/` or `path_resolution_root/tasks-done/`
- ✅ Supports timestamp prefixes for completed tasks
- ✅ Uses proper filename format: `T-{clean_id}.md` (open) or `{timestamp}-T-{clean_id}.md` (done)

**2. `find_object_path` (lines 137-149):**
- ✅ Checks root-level task directories first (`tasks-open/` and `tasks-done/`)
- ✅ Prefers `tasks-open` over `tasks-done` for duplicate IDs
- ✅ Falls back to hierarchical search if not found at root level

**3. `id_to_path` (lines 56-132):**
- ✅ Supports standalone tasks via `find_object_path`
- ✅ Provides appropriate error messages

**4. `path_to_id` (lines 363-377):**
- ✅ Handles both `T-{id}.md` and `{timestamp}-T-{id}.md` formats
- ✅ Supports round-trip conversion

#### Directory Structure Patterns

**Hierarchical Tasks:**
```
planning/projects/P-{project}/epics/E-{epic}/features/F-{feature}/
├── tasks-open/T-{task}.md
└── tasks-done/{timestamp}-T-{task}.md
```

**Standalone Tasks (Already Supported):**
```
planning/
├── tasks-open/T-{task}.md
└── tasks-done/{timestamp}-T-{task}.md
```

#### Security Analysis

**✅ Existing Security Measures:**
- Input validation for `kind` and `obj_id` parameters
- Path sanitization in `resolve_path_for_new_object`
- Prefix stripping logic prevents injection attacks
- Directory traversal protection via absolute path resolution
- Same validation patterns apply to standalone tasks

#### Test Coverage Analysis

**✅ Current Test Coverage:**
- Hierarchical task resolution (tasks-open and tasks-done)
- Preference for tasks-open over tasks-done
- Round-trip conversion between IDs and paths
- Complex hierarchy resolution
- Error handling for missing objects

**❌ Missing Test Coverage:**
- Standalone task path resolution
- Standalone task creation via `resolve_path_for_new_object` with `parent_id=None`
- Mixed hierarchy and standalone task scenarios
- Root-level task directory creation
- Security validation for standalone task paths

#### Modification Plan

**Functions requiring NO modification:**
1. `resolve_path_for_new_object` - ✅ Already supports standalone tasks
2. `find_object_path` - ✅ Already supports standalone tasks
3. `id_to_path` - ✅ Already supports standalone tasks
4. `path_to_id` - ✅ Already supports standalone tasks
5. `children_of` - ✅ Already correctly handles task children

**Enhancement opportunities:**
1. **Test Coverage** - Add comprehensive tests for standalone task functionality
2. **Documentation** - Document the existing standalone task support
3. **Error Messages** - Could be enhanced for standalone task specific scenarios

#### Edge Cases Identified

**1. Duplicate Task IDs:**
- ✅ System correctly prefers `tasks-open` over `tasks-done`
- ✅ Hierarchical tasks and standalone tasks can coexist with same ID

**2. Path Resolution Priority:**
- ✅ Standalone tasks are checked first (root level)
- ✅ Falls back to hierarchical search if not found

**3. Directory Creation:**
- ✅ `ensure_parent_dirs` handles creation of root-level task directories
- ✅ Proper path resolution for both scenarios

#### Recommendations

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Add comprehensive test coverage** for standalone task functionality
2. **Document the existing implementation** in code comments
3. **Verify integration** with MCP tools (createObject, updateObject)

**Future Enhancements:**
1. Consider standalone task organization features (categories, tags)
2. Add CLI commands for standalone task management
3. Implement standalone task discovery and listing

**Status:** Analysis complete. Standalone task path resolution is already implemented and functional.
**2025-07-18T18:59:23.333377Z** - Conducted comprehensive analysis of path_resolver.py implementation. Critical finding: standalone task support is already fully implemented and functional in the current codebase. No core functionality modifications are needed. The system already supports standalone tasks through root-level tasks-open/ and tasks-done/ directories, with proper path resolution, security validation, and round-trip conversion. Analysis identified test coverage gaps and documentation needs as the primary enhancement opportunities.
