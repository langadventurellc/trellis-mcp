### Implementation Requirements
Implement comprehensive security validation to prevent path traversal attacks and ensure all standalone task paths remain within designated directories.

### Technical Approach
- Add path traversal prevention for standalone task directories
- Validate resolved paths stay within project boundaries
- Implement security checks for all path construction operations
- Add logging for security violations

### Acceptance Criteria
- Prevent "../" and similar path traversal attempts
- Ensure all paths resolve within the planning directory structure
- Block access to system files and directories outside the project
- Provide security audit logging for suspicious attempts
- Maintain performance while adding security checks

### Dependencies
- T-add-input-validation-for: Need basic validation infrastructure

### Security Considerations
- Block all forms of path traversal attacks
- Validate against symbolic link attacks
- Ensure proper handling of absolute paths
- Prevent access to sensitive system directories

### Testing Requirements
- Test prevention of "../" path traversal attempts
- Test handling of absolute paths
- Test symbolic link security
- Test various attack vectors and edge cases
- Test performance impact of security checks

### Implementation Details
- Add security validation functions
- Integrate security checks into path resolution functions
- Use consistent security patterns across the codebase
- Add comprehensive logging for security events
- Include performance benchmarks for security overhead

### Log


**2025-07-18T19:33:10.569819Z** - Successfully implemented comprehensive security validation for path traversal prevention in the Trellis MCP system. Enhanced the existing security validation framework with three new key functions: validate_path_boundaries() for path boundary validation, validate_path_construction_security() for path component validation, and validate_standalone_task_path_security() for comprehensive task path security. These functions provide multi-layered protection against path traversal attacks, symbolic link attacks, null byte injection, control character injection, and other security vulnerabilities. Integrated the new security validation into path_resolver.py for all path operations. Added comprehensive test coverage with 31 new test cases covering all attack vectors and edge cases. All quality checks pass including formatting, linting, type checking, and all 1410 tests.
