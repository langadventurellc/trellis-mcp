### Implementation Requirements
Add comprehensive input validation for standalone task path operations to ensure security and data integrity.

### Technical Approach
- Add validation functions for task IDs used in standalone paths
- Validate status parameters for standalone tasks
- Add path sanitization for standalone task directories
- Follow existing validation patterns in the codebase

### Acceptance Criteria
- Validate task IDs to prevent malformed paths
- Sanitize status parameters to prevent directory traversal
- Ensure proper character restrictions for task identifiers
- Provide clear error messages for validation failures
- Maintain compatibility with existing validation

### Dependencies
- T-add-standalone-task-detection: Need detection logic for routing

### Security Considerations
- Prevent directory traversal attacks via task IDs
- Validate all input parameters against injection attacks
- Ensure proper character restrictions for file/directory names
- Handle edge cases with special characters

### Testing Requirements
- Test validation with various invalid task IDs
- Test validation with malicious input attempts
- Test validation with edge cases (empty, whitespace, special chars)
- Test error message clarity and usefulness
- Test integration with existing validation

### Implementation Details
- Add validation functions for standalone task parameters
- Integrate validation into existing path resolution functions
- Use consistent error handling patterns
- Add appropriate logging for validation failures
- Include comprehensive docstrings for validation functions

### Log


**2025-07-18T19:23:11.413984Z** - Successfully implemented comprehensive input validation for standalone task path operations. Added validation functions to prevent directory traversal attacks, path injection, and other security vulnerabilities while maintaining compatibility with existing validation patterns. Key features include:

1. **Security Validation Functions**: Added `validate_standalone_task_path_parameters()` and supporting functions that check for path traversal sequences, invalid characters, control characters, and reserved system names.

2. **Path Resolver Integration**: Integrated validation into `id_to_path()`, `resolve_path_for_new_object()`, and `children_of()` functions to secure all task path operations.

3. **Compatibility**: Maintained backward compatibility with existing task IDs by using filesystem limits (255 chars) rather than strict 32-character limits for length validation.

4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Created extensive unit tests (35 tests) and integration tests (20 tests) covering all validation scenarios, security edge cases, and compatibility requirements.

5. **Clear Error Messages**: Implemented meaningful error messages that help users understand validation failures while maintaining security.

The implementation successfully prevents common security vulnerabilities like directory traversal attacks (../../../etc/passwd) and path injection while allowing all existing valid operations to continue working.
