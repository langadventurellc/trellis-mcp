### Implementation Requirements
Add logic to detect whether a task is standalone (no parent feature) or hierarchy-based, and route path resolution accordingly.

### Technical Approach
- Create a helper function to determine if a task is standalone based on parent_id
- Modify existing functions to use this detection logic
- Ensure consistent behavior across all path resolution functions
- Follow the existing pattern in `resolve_path_for_new_object` (lines 236-251)

### Acceptance Criteria
- Add `is_standalone_task(parent_id)` helper function
- Integrate detection logic into relevant functions
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing task resolution
- Handle edge cases like empty strings, None values, and whitespace

### Dependencies
- T-analyze-existing-path-resolution: Need to understand current patterns first

### Security Considerations
- Validate parent_id parameter to prevent injection attacks
- Ensure proper sanitization of input parameters
- Handle malformed or unexpected input gracefully

### Testing Requirements
- Test with None parent_id
- Test with empty string parent_id
- Test with whitespace-only parent_id
- Test with valid feature parent_id
- Test with malformed parent_id

### Implementation Details
- Add the helper function near the top of the file after imports
- Use consistent naming conventions with existing code
- Add proper docstring documentation
- Include type hints for parameters and return values

### Log


**2025-07-18T19:04:22.881292Z** - Analyzed the standalone task detection requirements and confirmed that all requested functionality is already implemented and thoroughly tested. The `is_standalone_task()` helper function exists in `src/trellis_mcp/validation/task_utils.py` with comprehensive edge case handling. Path resolution logic in `src/trellis_mcp/path_resolver.py` (lines 236-251) already routes standalone tasks appropriately. All 15 standalone task tests pass, confirming the implementation meets all acceptance criteria. No code changes were needed as the functionality already exists and is working correctly.
