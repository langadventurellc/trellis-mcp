### Implementation Requirements
Create comprehensive unit tests for standalone task path construction functionality, including edge cases and error conditions.

### Technical Approach
- Create test file for standalone task path construction
- Test `resolve_path_for_new_object` with standalone tasks
- Test helper functions for path construction
- Use pytest framework following existing test patterns

### Acceptance Criteria
- Test standalone task path construction for different statuses
- Test directory structure creation
- Test filename generation for various scenarios
- Test error handling for invalid inputs
- Test edge cases with malformed task IDs
- Achieve high test coverage for new functionality

### Dependencies
- T-extend-resolve-path-for-new: Need implementation to test
- T-add-standalone-task-path: Need helper functions to test

### Security Considerations
- Test input validation and sanitization
- Test directory traversal prevention
- Test handling of malicious input

### Testing Requirements
- Test cases for status="open", status="done", and status=None
- Test cases for various task ID formats
- Test cases for directory creation
- Test cases for filename generation
- Test cases for error conditions
- Test integration with existing hierarchy-based tests

### Implementation Details
- Create or extend existing test file for path_resolver
- Follow existing test patterns and naming conventions
- Use appropriate pytest fixtures for test setup
- Include parameterized tests for multiple scenarios
- Add docstrings for test functions

### Log

#### 2025-07-18 15:05:00 - Task Implementation Complete
Implemented comprehensive unit tests for standalone task path construction functionality in `resolve_path_for_new_object`. Created a new test class `TestResolvePathForNewObjectStandaloneTasks` with 34 test methods covering:

**Test Coverage:**
- Basic functionality tests for different statuses (open, done, None)
- Edge cases for various task ID formats and parent handling
- Error handling for invalid inputs, malformed IDs, and security threats
- Security validation against path traversal, control characters, and reserved names
- Integration tests with existing hierarchy-based functions
- Parametrized tests for comprehensive coverage

**Implementation:**
- Added test class to existing `/tests/unit/test_path_resolver.py` file
- Followed existing test patterns and naming conventions
- Used pytest fixtures and parametrized tests for multiple scenarios
- Included comprehensive docstrings for all test functions
- Ensured all tests pass with proper formatting and linting

**Quality Assurance:**
- All 34 new tests pass successfully
- Maintained 100% passing rate for existing 166 path resolver tests
- Passed all pre-commit checks (isort, black, flake8, pyright)
- Comprehensive security validation testing
- High test coverage for new functionality

**Files Modified:**
- `/tests/unit/test_path_resolver.py` - Added TestResolvePathForNewObjectStandaloneTasks class with 34 test methods


**2025-07-18T20:06:48.224394Z** - Implemented comprehensive unit tests for standalone task path construction functionality in resolve_path_for_new_object. Created a new test class TestResolvePathForNewObjectStandaloneTasks with 34 test methods covering basic functionality, edge cases, error handling, security validation, and integration tests. All tests pass with proper formatting and linting.
