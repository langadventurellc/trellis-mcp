### Implementation Requirements
Create integration tests that verify path resolution works correctly when both standalone and hierarchy-based tasks coexist in the same project.

### Technical Approach
- Create integration test scenarios with mixed task types
- Test path resolution with both standalone and hierarchy-based tasks
- Verify no conflicts or interference between the two systems
- Test performance with mixed task environments

### Acceptance Criteria
- Integration tests pass with both task types present
- No performance degradation with mixed task environments
- Correct task type identification and routing
- Proper error handling when tasks exist in both locations
- Consistent behavior across all path resolution functions

### Dependencies
- T-unit-tests-for-standalone-task: Need basic unit tests to pass first
- T-unit-tests-for-standalone-task-1: Need parsing tests to pass first

### Security Considerations
- Test security measures work across both task types
- Verify no security vulnerabilities in mixed environments
- Test access control consistency

### Testing Requirements
- Test scenarios with both standalone and hierarchy-based tasks
- Test edge cases where task IDs might conflict
- Test performance with large numbers of mixed tasks
- Test error handling in mixed environments
- Test consistency of metadata across task types

### Implementation Details
- Create integration test file or extend existing tests
- Use realistic test data with both task types
- Include performance benchmarks
- Test various combinations of task statuses and locations
- Add comprehensive assertions for all test scenarios
