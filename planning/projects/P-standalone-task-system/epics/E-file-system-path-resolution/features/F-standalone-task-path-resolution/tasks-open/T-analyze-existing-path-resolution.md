### Implementation Requirements
Review the current path_resolver.py implementation to understand existing patterns and identify the exact modification points for standalone task support.

### Technical Approach
- Examine the current `resolve_path_for_new_object` function (lines 135-291)
- Analyze the standalone task handling logic already present (lines 236-251)
- Review the `id_to_path` and `path_to_id` functions for modification points
- Identify where standalone task detection logic should be added

### Acceptance Criteria
- Document the current standalone task implementation (already partially implemented)
- Identify the specific functions that need modification for full standalone task support
- Create a modification plan for extending the existing logic
- Understand the current directory structure patterns for both hierarchy and standalone tasks

### Dependencies
- None (analysis task)

### Security Considerations
- Note existing input validation patterns
- Identify security measures already in place for path construction
- Document any security considerations for standalone task paths

### Testing Requirements
- Document existing test patterns for path resolution
- Identify test cases that need to be added for standalone tasks
- Note any edge cases in current implementation

### Files to Analyze
- src/trellis_mcp/path_resolver.py (primary focus)
- src/trellis_mcp/fs_utils.py (supporting utilities)
- Any existing test files for path resolution
