### Implementation Requirements
Implement comprehensive security validation to prevent path traversal attacks and ensure all standalone task paths remain within designated directories.

### Technical Approach
- Add path traversal prevention for standalone task directories
- Validate resolved paths stay within project boundaries
- Implement security checks for all path construction operations
- Add logging for security violations

### Acceptance Criteria
- Prevent "../" and similar path traversal attempts
- Ensure all paths resolve within the planning directory structure
- Block access to system files and directories outside the project
- Provide security audit logging for suspicious attempts
- Maintain performance while adding security checks

### Dependencies
- T-add-input-validation-for: Need basic validation infrastructure

### Security Considerations
- Block all forms of path traversal attacks
- Validate against symbolic link attacks
- Ensure proper handling of absolute paths
- Prevent access to sensitive system directories

### Testing Requirements
- Test prevention of "../" path traversal attempts
- Test handling of absolute paths
- Test symbolic link security
- Test various attack vectors and edge cases
- Test performance impact of security checks

### Implementation Details
- Add security validation functions
- Integrate security checks into path resolution functions
- Use consistent security patterns across the codebase
- Add comprehensive logging for security events
- Include performance benchmarks for security overhead
