### Purpose and Functionality
Ensure standalone tasks are fully integrated with all existing discovery mechanisms including task listing, filtering, and management operations. This provides seamless operation across both task storage patterns.

### Key Components to Implement
- Integrate standalone task discovery with MCP server operations
- Update task listing and filtering logic
- Ensure task management operations work across both storage patterns
- Maintain consistent task metadata and behavior

### Acceptance Criteria
- All MCP operations work seamlessly with standalone tasks
- Task filtering and sorting works across both storage patterns
- Task metadata is consistent regardless of storage location
- No functional differences between standalone and hierarchy-based tasks

### Technical Requirements
- Update MCP server handlers to support mixed task discovery
- Ensure consistent task object creation and manipulation
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing client expectations
- Handle edge cases where mixed task types interact

### Dependencies on Other Features
- F-scanner-discovery-enhancement: Requires scanner to find standalone tasks
- F-file-organization-system: Requires proper file organization for discovery

### Implementation Guidance
- Review all MCP server endpoints that handle task operations
- Ensure task metadata includes necessary information for proper handling
- Test all task-related operations with mixed task environments
- Follow existing error handling and response patterns

### Testing Requirements
- Integration tests for all MCP operations with standalone tasks
- End-to-end tests with mixed task environments
- Performance tests for large numbers of mixed task types
- Regression tests to ensure hierarchy-based tasks remain unaffected

### Security Considerations
- Maintain consistent authorization checks across task types
- Ensure task access controls work properly with new file organization
- Validate all task operations for security compliance

### Performance Requirements
- No performance degradation for existing task operations
- Efficient handling of mixed task discovery and filtering
- Scalable performance with large numbers of standalone tasks
