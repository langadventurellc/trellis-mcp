### Purpose
Fix the `getNextReviewableTask` MCP operation to include standalone tasks in review status, ensuring complete task discovery across both storage patterns.

### Current Issue
The `get_oldest_review()` function in `src/trellis_mcp/query.py` only searches hierarchical tasks in the `planning/projects/` directory structure, completely ignoring standalone tasks in `planning/tasks-open/` that have status='review'.

### Technical Requirements
- Extend `get_oldest_review()` to scan `planning/tasks-open/` directory for standalone tasks
- Combine results from both hierarchical and standalone task scans
- Maintain existing priority and timestamp ordering logic
- Preserve backward compatibility with existing behavior

### Implementation Approach
1. Add standalone task scanning after hierarchical task scanning
2. Use existing `scan_tasks()` utility for consistency
3. Filter standalone tasks by status='review' 
4. Merge results and apply existing oldest-updated timestamp logic
5. Ensure security validation applies to both task types

### Acceptance Criteria
- `getNextReviewableTask` returns standalone tasks when they are the oldest in review
- Existing hierarchical task review functionality remains unchanged
- Priority ordering works correctly across both task types
- Performance remains acceptable with mixed task scanning

### Testing Requirements
- Add unit tests for standalone task review discovery
- Add integration tests with mixed task environments
- Test edge cases with no reviewable tasks of each type
- Verify timestamp ordering across both task types

### Security Considerations
- Apply same path validation to standalone task scanning
- Ensure proper access controls for standalone tasks in review
- Validate task metadata consistency

### Performance Requirements
- Review discovery should complete in < 50ms for typical project sizes
- No significant performance degradation with standalone task inclusion
- Memory usage should remain efficient with iterator-based scanning

### Files to Modify
- `src/trellis_mcp/query.py` - Add standalone task scanning to `get_oldest_review()`
- `tests/test_query.py` - Add comprehensive test coverage

### Log

**Implementation Summary:**

Successfully fixed the `getNextReviewableTask` MCP operation to include standalone tasks in review status. The solution replaced the manual hierarchical-only scanning in `get_oldest_review()` with the existing `scan_tasks()` utility function, which already handles both hierarchical and standalone tasks correctly.

**Key Changes:**
- Modified `get_oldest_review()` in `src/trellis_mcp/query.py` to use `scan_tasks()` instead of manual hierarchical scanning
- Added proper handling for the project root parameter to work with the existing `scan_tasks()` function
- Removed unused import (`parse_object`) and fixed code formatting
- Added comprehensive unit tests covering all scenarios: standalone-only, hierarchical-only, and mixed environments
- Verified priority ordering and timestamp logic works correctly across both task types

**Testing Results:**
- All 12 unit tests pass, including 5 new tests specifically for standalone task discovery
- Integration tests pass, confirming the fix works end-to-end with mixed task environments
- Performance remains acceptable with iterator-based scanning from `scan_tasks()`
- Security validation continues to work correctly for both task types

The implementation maintains backward compatibility while extending functionality to include standalone tasks in the review discovery workflow. The solution is robust, well-tested, and follows the existing codebase patterns.
