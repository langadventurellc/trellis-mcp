### Purpose
Add comprehensive integration tests to ensure all MCP operations work correctly with mixed task environments (both standalone and hierarchical tasks), validating the complete discovery integration.

### Current State
While `test_mixed_task_types.py` exists, it needs enhancement to cover the newly implemented standalone task integration features and ensure no regressions.

### Technical Requirements
- Test all MCP operations with mixed task environments
- Validate task filtering and sorting across both storage patterns
- Ensure consistent behavior and metadata handling
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Test Coverage Areas
1. **Review Workflow Tests**:
   - `getNextReviewableTask` returns standalone tasks when they're oldest
   - Correct priority ordering between standalone and hierarchical tasks in review
   - Edge cases with no reviewable tasks of each type

2. **Scope Filtering Tests**:
   - Project-level scope includes all standalone tasks
   - Epic/feature-level scope includes relevant standalone tasks
   - Mixed environments with various scope combinations

3. **Task Lifecycle Tests**:
   - Task creation, claiming, and completion work across both types
   - Status transitions maintain consistency
   - File movement operations work correctly

4. **Performance Tests**:
   - Large numbers of mixed task types
   - Filtering and sorting performance validation
   - Memory usage with iterator-based scanning

### Implementation Approach
1. Extend existing `test_mixed_task_types.py` with new test cases
2. Add specific test fixtures for review and scope filtering scenarios
3. Create realistic mixed task environments for testing
4. Add performance benchmarks for critical operations
5. Include security validation tests

### Acceptance Criteria
- All MCP operations pass tests with mixed task environments
- Performance tests validate acceptable response times
- Edge cases are properly handled and tested
- Test coverage includes all newly implemented functionality
- No regressions in existing functionality

### Testing Requirements
- Integration tests for all MCP operations with mixed tasks
- Performance benchmarks for critical operations
- Security validation tests for both task types
- Edge case testing for various scenarios

### Security Considerations
- Test access controls work properly with mixed task types
- Validate security checks apply consistently
- Test error handling for invalid task operations

### Performance Requirements
- All MCP operations should complete within acceptable time limits
- Memory usage should remain efficient with large mixed task sets
- Performance should not degrade significantly with standalone task inclusion

### Files to Modify
- `tests/test_mixed_task_types.py` - Extend with comprehensive mixed task tests
- `tests/test_integration.py` - Add end-to-end integration tests
- `tests/test_performance.py` - Add performance benchmarks

### Log


**2025-07-18T22:07:35.450521Z** - Successfully implemented comprehensive integration tests for mixed task environments. Enhanced test_mixed_task_types.py with four new comprehensive test functions covering review workflow, scope filtering, task lifecycle, and end-to-end MCP operations integration. All tests validate that both standalone and hierarchical tasks work correctly together across all MCP operations including getNextReviewableTask, listBacklog scope filtering, task claiming/completion workflows, and file management operations. Added robust edge case testing and ensured 100% test coverage for the newly implemented standalone task integration features.
