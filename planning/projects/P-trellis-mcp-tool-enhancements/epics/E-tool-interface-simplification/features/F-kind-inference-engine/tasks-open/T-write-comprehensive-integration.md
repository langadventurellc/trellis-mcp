# Write Comprehensive Integration Tests and Performance Benchmarks

## Context

Create comprehensive integration tests and performance benchmarks for the complete Kind Inference Engine to ensure reliability, performance, and readiness for production use. This task follows existing testing patterns in `tests/` and validates the entire inference pipeline.

## Related Files and Patterns

**Reference existing patterns:**
- `tests/` - Existing test structure and patterns
- `src/trellis_mcp/inference/engine.py` - Complete inference engine from previous task
- `pytest.ini` or similar - Testing configuration
- Performance testing patterns from existing codebase

**New files to create:**
- `tests/integration/test_inference_engine_integration.py` - Integration tests
- `tests/performance/test_inference_performance.py` - Performance benchmarks  
- `tests/test_inference_real_projects.py` - Real project structure tests
- `benchmarks/inference_benchmarks.py` - Standalone performance benchmarks

## Specific Implementation Requirements

### 1. Integration Test Suite
Create comprehensive integration tests covering the complete inference pipeline:
- **End-to-end inference workflows** with real project structures
- **Cross-system compatibility** testing (hierarchical + standalone)
- **Error handling integration** across all components
- **Cache behavior validation** under various scenarios
- **Concurrent access testing** for thread safety

### 2. Performance Benchmark Suite
Implement performance benchmarks to validate requirements:
- **Inference speed benchmarks** (target: < 10ms)
- **Cache performance testing** (target: < 1ms for hits)
- **Memory usage profiling** under various loads
- **Concurrent performance testing** with multiple threads
- **Large project scaling tests** with realistic data volumes

### 3. Real Project Structure Testing
Test with realistic project structures:
- **Hierarchical project testing** with deep nesting
- **Mixed environment testing** (hierarchical + standalone)
- **Large project testing** with 1000+ objects
- **Edge case project structures** (orphaned objects, missing parents)
- **Corrupted object handling** with malformed files

### 4. Regression Testing Framework
Create regression tests to prevent future issues:
- **API compatibility testing** for public interface stability
- **Performance regression detection** with benchmark baselines
- **Error message consistency** validation
- **Component integration stability** testing

## Technical Approach

### Integration Test Structure
```python
class TestInferenceEngineIntegration:
    @pytest.fixture
    def temp_project(self):
        # Create realistic temporary project structure
        
    @pytest.fixture
    def inference_engine(self, temp_project):
        # Initialize engine with test project
        
    def test_end_to_end_inference_workflow(self, inference_engine):
        # Test complete inference process
        
    def test_cross_system_compatibility(self, inference_engine):
        # Test mixed hierarchical/standalone environments
        
    def test_concurrent_inference_operations(self, inference_engine):
        # Test thread safety and concurrent access
```

### Performance Benchmark Structure
```python
class TestInferencePerformance:
    def test_inference_speed_benchmark(self):
        # Benchmark inference operations against < 10ms target
        
    def test_cache_hit_performance(self):
        # Benchmark cache operations against < 1ms target
        
    def test_memory_usage_profiling(self):
        # Profile memory usage under load
        
    def test_scaling_performance(self):
        # Test performance with large project structures
```

### Real Project Testing
```python
class TestRealProjectStructures:
    @pytest.mark.parametrize("project_type", [
        "hierarchical_deep",
        "mixed_environment", 
        "large_scale",
        "minimal_structure"
    ])
    def test_project_structure_compatibility(self, project_type):
        # Test with various realistic project structures
```

## Implementation Guidance

### Test Project Structure Creation
```python
def create_test_project_structure(project_type: str) -> Path:
    """Create realistic test project structures for different scenarios."""
    if project_type == "hierarchical_deep":
        # Create deep hierarchical structure with multiple levels
        pass
    elif project_type == "mixed_environment":
        # Create structure with both hierarchical and standalone objects
        pass
    # ... additional project types
```

### Performance Measurement Framework
```python
def benchmark_inference_speed():
    """Benchmark inference operations with statistical analysis."""
    inference_times = []
    for _ in range(1000):
        start_time = time.perf_counter()
        result = engine.infer_kind(test_id)
        end_time = time.perf_counter()
        inference_times.append(end_time - start_time)
    
    # Statistical analysis of results
    assert max(inference_times) < 0.010  # < 10ms
    assert statistics.mean(inference_times) < 0.005  # < 5ms average
```

### Concurrent Testing Framework
```python
def test_concurrent_inference():
    """Test concurrent access with multiple threads."""
    def inference_worker(engine, object_ids, results):
        for obj_id in object_ids:
            try:
                result = engine.infer_kind(obj_id)
                results.append((obj_id, result, None))
            except Exception as e:
                results.append((obj_id, None, e))
    
    # Run concurrent workers and validate results
