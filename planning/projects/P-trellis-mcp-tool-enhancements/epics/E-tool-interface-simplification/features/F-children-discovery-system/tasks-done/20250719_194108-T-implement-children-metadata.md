# Implement Children Metadata Cache

## Context
Create a caching layer for children discovery to optimize performance, following the patterns established in `src/trellis_mcp/validation/cache.py` (DependencyGraphCache) and `src/trellis_mcp/inference/cache.py` (InferenceCache).

## Technical Approach
Implement a `ChildrenCache` class that:
- Caches children metadata keyed by parent object path and modification time
- Uses file modification time-based invalidation like `DependencyGraphCache`
- Integrates with the existing cache architecture in the Trellis system
- Provides thread-safe access for concurrent children discovery operations
- Follows the performance patterns from the inference cache system

## Specific Implementation Requirements

### Cache Implementation (in `src/trellis_mcp/children/cache.py`)
```python
class ChildrenCache:
    """File modification time-based cache for children discovery.
    
    Provides efficient caching of children metadata with automatic invalidation
    when parent or child objects are modified, following patterns from the
    validation and inference cache systems.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, max_entries: int = 1000):
        """Initialize cache with LRU eviction."""
        
    def get_children(self, parent_path: Path) -> list[dict[str, str]] | None:
        """Retrieve cached children metadata if still valid."""
        
    def set_children(self, parent_path: Path, children: list[dict[str, str]]) -> None:
        """Cache children metadata with current modification times."""
        
    def invalidate(self, parent_path: Path) -> None:
        """Remove cached entry for specific parent."""
        
    def clear(self) -> None:
        """Clear all cached entries."""
```

### Cache Key Strategy
- **Primary Key**: Parent object file path (absolute path to .md file)
- **Validation Key**: Combination of parent mtime + all children mtimes
- **Cache Entry**: `{"children": list[dict], "parent_mtime": float, "children_mtimes": dict[str, float]}`
- **Invalidation**: Triggered when any parent or child file modification time changes

### Integration with Children Discovery
Modify `discover_immediate_children()` to:
- Check cache before file system scanning
- Store results in cache after successful discovery
- Handle cache misses gracefully (fallback to file system scan)
- Update cache when new children are discovered

### Performance Targets
- **Cache Hits**: < 1ms response time (following inference cache patterns)
- **Cache Misses**: < 100ms response time (includes file system scan + cache update)
- **Memory Usage**: Bounded to max_entries with LRU eviction
- **Thread Safety**: Support concurrent access from multiple getObject calls

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] **Cache Effectiveness**: 80%+ cache hit rate for repeated children discovery calls
- [ ] **Automatic Invalidation**: Cache entries invalidated when parent or child objects change
- [ ] **Thread Safety**: Concurrent access from multiple children discovery operations
- [ ] **Memory Bounds**: Cache size limited by max_entries with LRU eviction
- [ ] **Fallback Behavior**: Graceful degradation when cache operations fail

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] **Cache Hit Speed**: < 1ms for cache hits (following inference cache patterns)
- [ ] **Cache Miss Speed**: < 100ms for cache misses (includes file scan + cache update)
- [ ] **Memory Efficiency**: Reasonable memory footprint per cached entry
- [ ] **Invalidation Speed**: < 10ms for cache invalidation operations

### Integration Requirements
- [ ] **Transparent Operation**: Children discovery works identically with/without cache
- [ ] **Error Isolation**: Cache failures don't break children discovery functionality
- [ ] **Configuration**: Cache can be enabled/disabled via settings
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Cache hit/miss metrics available for performance monitoring

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests (in `tests/test_children_cache.py`)
- [ ] **Basic Operations**: Test get, set, invalidate, clear operations
- [ ] **Modification Time Tracking**: Verify cache invalidation when files change
- [ ] **LRU Eviction**: Test cache size limits and entry eviction
- [ ] **Thread Safety**: Concurrent access from multiple threads
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Cache behavior with file system errors

### Performance Tests (in `tests/performance/test_children_cache.py`)
- [ ] **Cache Hit Performance**: Measure < 1ms response times for cache hits
- [ ] **Cache Miss Performance**: Measure < 100ms response times for cache misses
- [ ] **Memory Usage**: Monitor cache memory consumption under load
- [ ] **Concurrent Performance**: Test cache performance with multiple threads

### Integration Tests (in `tests/integration/test_children_cache_integration.py`)
- [ ] **Discovery Integration**: Test cache integration with `discover_immediate_children()`
- [ ] **GetObject Integration**: Test cache integration with enhanced getObject tool
- [ ] **File Change Detection**: Test cache invalidation when project files change
- [ ] **Large Project Performance**: Test cache effectiveness with large project hierarchies

## Implementation Guidance

### Cache Storage Structure
```python
# Cache entry structure
cache_entry = {
    "children": [
        {
            "id": "child-id",
            "title": "Child Title", 
            "status": "open",
            "kind": "epic",
            "created": "2024-01-01T00:00:00",
            "file_path": "/path/to/child.md"
        }
    ],
    "parent_mtime": 1642723200.123,  # Parent file modification time
    "children_mtimes": {             # Child file modification times
        "/path/to/child1.md": 1642723100.456,
        "/path/to/child2.md": 1642723150.789,
    },
    "cached_at": 1642723200.999      # Cache timestamp
}
```

### Performance Optimization Strategies
- **Batch Mtime Checks**: Check all child modification times in single operation
- **Lazy Validation**: Only validate cache entry when accessed
- **Memory Pooling**: Reuse cache entry objects to reduce memory allocation
- **Key Normalization**: Use normalized paths for consistent cache keys

### Error Handling Approach
- **Cache Miss**: Fall back to file system scan, log cache miss
- **File System Errors**: Return empty cache result, proceed with normal discovery
- **Cache Corruption**: Clear affected entries, rebuild from file system
- **Thread Conflicts**: Use locks for write operations, allow concurrent reads

## Documentation Requirements
- [ ] **Class Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings with usage examples
- [ ] **Performance Notes**: Document expected performance characteristics
- [ ] **Configuration Guide**: How to enable/disable and configure cache
- [ ] **Troubleshooting**: Common cache issues and debugging approaches

## Dependencies
- Successful completion of T-create-immediate-children task
- Existing cache patterns from `src/trellis_mcp/validation/cache.py`
- Thread safety patterns from `src/trellis_mcp/inference/cache.py`
- File system utilities and path resolution functions
