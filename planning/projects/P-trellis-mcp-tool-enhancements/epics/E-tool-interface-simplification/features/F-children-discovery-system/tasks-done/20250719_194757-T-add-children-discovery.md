# Add Children Discovery Performance Benchmarking

## Context
Implement comprehensive performance benchmarking for the children discovery system following the patterns in `src/trellis_mcp/validation/benchmark.py` (PerformanceBenchmark class) to ensure the system meets the specified performance targets.

## Technical Approach
Create benchmarking infrastructure that:
- Measures cold vs warm performance for children discovery operations
- Tests performance across different parent types and collection sizes
- Validates cache effectiveness and speedup factors
- Follows the benchmark patterns established in the validation system
- Integrates with the existing performance monitoring infrastructure

## Specific Implementation Requirements

### Benchmark Implementation (in `src/trellis_mcp/children/benchmark.py`)
```python
class ChildrenDiscoveryBenchmark:
    """Performance benchmarking for children discovery operations.
    
    Provides comprehensive performance measurement following patterns from
    the validation benchmark system, measuring both cold and warm performance
    across different parent types and collection sizes.
    """
    
    def benchmark_discovery_performance(self, test_scenarios: list[dict]) -> dict:
        """Benchmark children discovery across multiple scenarios."""
        
    def benchmark_cache_effectiveness(self, project_root: Path) -> dict:
        """Measure cache hit rates and speedup factors."""
        
    def benchmark_collection_sizes(self, project_root: Path) -> dict:
        """Test performance with different numbers of children."""
        
    def generate_performance_report(self) -> str:
        """Generate human-readable performance report."""
```

### Test Scenarios
```python
# Benchmark scenarios covering all parent types and collection sizes
benchmark_scenarios = [
    # Small collections (1-10 children)
    {"parent_type": "project", "child_count": 5, "expected_time_ms": 50},
    {"parent_type": "epic", "child_count": 8, "expected_time_ms": 50},
    {"parent_type": "feature", "child_count": 10, "expected_time_ms": 50},
    
    # Medium collections (11-50 children)  
    {"parent_type": "project", "child_count": 25, "expected_time_ms": 100},
    {"parent_type": "epic", "child_count": 30, "expected_time_ms": 100},
    {"parent_type": "feature", "child_count": 45, "expected_time_ms": 100},
    
    # Large collections (51+ children)
    {"parent_type": "project", "child_count": 75, "expected_time_ms": 200},
    {"parent_type": "epic", "child_count": 100, "expected_time_ms": 200},
    {"parent_type": "feature", "child_count": 150, "expected_time_ms": 200},
    
    # Edge cases
    {"parent_type": "task", "child_count": 0, "expected_time_ms": 10},
    {"parent_type": "project", "child_count": 0, "expected_time_ms": 10},
]
```

### Performance Metrics Collection
- **Cold Performance**: First-time discovery without cache (file system scan)
- **Warm Performance**: Subsequent discovery with cache hits
- **Cache Effectiveness**: Hit rate, miss rate, speedup factors
- **Collection Size Impact**: Performance scaling with number of children
- **Memory Usage**: Peak memory consumption during discovery operations

### Integration with Existing Benchmarks
- Follow patterns from `src/trellis_mcp/validation/benchmark.py`
- Use same timing methodology and result formatting
- Integrate with existing performance monitoring infrastructure
- Provide consistent reporting format with other benchmark tools

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Performance Validation
- [ ] **Small Collections**: < 50ms for 1-10 children (cold), < 5ms (warm)
- [ ] **Medium Collections**: < 100ms for 11-50 children (cold), < 10ms (warm)

## Implementation Guidance

### Benchmark Test Data Generation
```python
# Generate test project structures for benchmarking
def create_benchmark_project(child_counts: dict[str, int]) -> Path:
    """Create test project with specified child counts for benchmarking."""
    # Projects with specified number of epics
    # Epics with specified number of features  
    # Features with specified number of tasks
    # Tasks with no children (empty case)
```

### Performance Measurement Strategy
- **Timing Precision**: Use high-resolution timers for accurate measurement
- **Warm-up Runs**: Execute discovery operations before measurement to warm caches
- **Multiple Iterations**: Average results across multiple runs for statistical validity
- **Environment Control**: Account for system load and background processes

### Cache Performance Analysis
```python
# Cache performance metrics
cache_metrics = {
    "hit_rate": float,           # Percentage of cache hits
    "miss_rate": float,          # Percentage of cache misses  
    "cold_avg_time_ms": float,   # Average cold performance
    "warm_avg_time_ms": float,   # Average warm performance
    "speedup_factor": float,     # warm/cold performance ratio
    "memory_usage_mb": float,    # Peak memory usage
}
```

### Optimization Recommendations
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Identify file I/O, parsing, or cache operations causing delays
- **Scaling Issues**: Detect operations that don't scale linearly with collection size
- **Memory Leaks**: Monitor for memory usage growth over multiple benchmark runs
- **Cache Tuning**: Optimize cache size and eviction policies based on benchmark results

## Documentation Requirements
- [ ] **Benchmark Guide**: How to run benchmarks and interpret results
- [ ] **Performance Targets**: Document expected performance characteristics
- [ ] **Optimization Guide**: Recommendations for improving performance
- [ ] **Troubleshooting**: Common performance issues and solutions
