## Purpose

Create comprehensive integration tests that verify the simplified getObject and updateObject tools work correctly end-to-end, including kind inference, response format validation, error handling, and compatibility with existing functionality.

## Context

After implementing simplified tools and updating server registration, comprehensive testing is needed to ensure the tools work correctly in real scenarios. This includes testing kind inference integration, response format changes, error handling, and ensuring no regressions in existing functionality.

**Reference files:**
- Look for existing test files in `tests/` directory
- Study test patterns for current getObject and updateObject tools
- Examine integration test patterns and utilities

**Technologies to use:**
- Existing test framework (likely pytest)
- Test utilities for creating test objects and planning structures
- Existing test patterns for tool testing

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Test Structure and Organization
- Create or extend test files for simplified tool testing
- Follow existing test organization patterns
- Include both unit and integration level tests
- Test cross-system compatibility (hierarchical and standalone objects)

### 2. Kind Inference Integration Tests
Test that simplified tools correctly integrate with the kind inference engine:
```python
# Test valid ID patterns
def test_getobject_infers_project_kind():
    result = simplified_getObject(id="P-test-project", projectRoot=test_root)
    assert result["kind"] == "project"
    assert "file_path" not in result  # Clean response format

def test_updateobject_infers_task_kind():
    result = simplified_updateObject(
        id="T-test-task", 
        projectRoot=test_root,
        yamlPatch={"status": "in-progress"}
    )
    assert result["kind"] == "task"
    assert "file_path" not in result  # Clean response format
```

### 3. Response Format Validation Tests
Verify that simplified tools return clean response formats:
- Confirm `file_path` is removed from all responses
- Verify `kind` field contains inferred value
- Ensure all other expected fields are present
- Test response format consistency across different scenarios

### 4. Error Handling Tests
Test comprehensive error scenarios:
- Invalid ID patterns (malformed prefixes)
- Non-existent objects (valid format but missing file)
- Kind inference failures
- File system access errors
- Validation errors in updates

### 5. Compatibility and Regression Tests
Ensure simplified tools maintain full compatibility:
- Test with both hierarchical and standalone objects
- Verify children discovery continues working
- Test complex update scenarios (cascade deletion, protected objects)
- Ensure dependency validation works correctly
- Test atomic operation guarantees

## Detailed Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Examine Existing Test Structure
1. Locate existing test files for getObject and updateObject
2. Understand test utilities and setup patterns
3. Identify test data creation and cleanup patterns
4. Note integration test architecture

### Step 2: Create Test Data Setup
1. Create test project structures with both hierarchical and standalone objects
2. Set up test objects with valid ID patterns (P-, E-, F-, T-)
3. Create test scenarios for error conditions
4. Ensure test data covers edge cases

### Step 3: Implement Kind Inference Tests
1. Test all valid ID prefix patterns (P-, E-, F-, T-)
2. Test invalid ID patterns and error responses
3. Verify kind inference errors are handled correctly
4. Test inference with missing objects

### Step 4: Implement Response Format Tests
1. Test response format for all object types
2. Verify file_path removal in all scenarios
3. Test response format consistency
4. Validate children discovery response format

### Step 5: Implement Error Handling Tests
1. Test invalid parameter combinations
2. Test file system access errors
3. Test validation errors in updates
4. Test error message clarity and consistency

### Step 6: Implement Complex Scenario Tests
1. Test cascade deletion with simplified interface
2. Test protected object validation
3. Test dependency graph validation
4. Test atomic operation rollbacks
5. Test concurrent access scenarios
