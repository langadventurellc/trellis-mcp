# Tool Management and Cleanup Epic

## Purpose and Goals

Manage the lifecycle of MCP tools by safely removing deprecated functionality and ensuring clean tool registration. This epic focuses on removing the getNextReviewableTask tool completely from the system while maintaining system integrity and updating all related components including server registration, imports, tests, and documentation.

## Major Components and Deliverables

### 1. Safe Tool Removal
- **Complete removal** of getNextReviewableTask tool from MCP server registration
- **Cleanup of implementation files** and associated code modules
- **Import and reference cleanup** throughout the codebase
- **Graceful handling** of any existing dependencies or usage patterns

### 2. Server Registration Updates
- **FastMCP server configuration** updates to remove deprecated tool
- **Tool registry cleanup** to prevent registration of removed tools  
- **Server startup validation** to ensure clean tool initialization
- **Error handling** for any attempts to access removed tools

### 3. Test and Documentation Cleanup
- **Test suite cleanup** to remove tests for deprecated functionality
- **Documentation updates** to remove references to deprecated tools
- **API documentation cleanup** to maintain accurate tool listings
- **Migration guidance** for users transitioning away from deprecated tools

### 4. System Integrity Validation
- **Dependency analysis** to ensure no remaining references to removed tools
- **Integration testing** to validate system works correctly after tool removal
- **Performance validation** to ensure removal doesn't impact other tool performance
- **Error handling verification** for removed tool access attempts

## Integration Points

### With Enhanced Task Claiming Epic
- **Dependency**: Tool removal should occur after enhanced claiming is complete and validated
- **Workflow Impact**: Ensure no claiming workflows depend on getNextReviewableTask functionality
- **Testing Coordination**: Validate enhanced claiming works correctly after tool removal

### With Tool Interface Simplification Epic
- **Sequential Dependency**: Tool removal should happen after interface simplification is stable
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error message patterns for removed vs. simplified tools
- **Documentation**: Coordinate documentation updates across both epics

### With Discovery Tools Implementation Epic
- **Timing**: Tool removal can proceed in parallel with discovery tool implementation
- **Registration**: Ensure new discovery tools are properly registered while removing deprecated tools
- **Testing**: Validate discovery tools work correctly in environment without getNextReviewableTask

## User Stories

### As a System Administrator
- I want deprecated tools completely removed so that the system is clean and maintainable
- I want clear error messages if someone tries to use removed tools so that migration is obvious
- I want comprehensive testing so that tool removal doesn't break other functionality

### As a Developer
- I want clean tool listings so that I only see available, supported tools
- I want updated documentation so that I know which tools are currently available
- I want migration guidance so that I can update my workflows to use alternative tools

### As an API Client
- I want tool discovery to return only valid tools so that my automation doesn't break
- I want clear error responses for removed tools so that I can handle removal gracefully
- I want consistent behavior so that tool removal doesn't affect other tool functionality

## Non-Functional Requirements

### System Integrity Standards
- **Clean removal**: No orphaned references or broken imports after tool removal
- **Server stability**: Server starts and operates normally after tool removal
- **Error handling**: Graceful error responses for attempts to access removed tools
- **Documentation accuracy**: All documentation reflects current tool availability

### Performance Considerations
- **Server startup**: No performance degradation during server initialization after removal
- **Tool discovery**: Faster tool listing due to reduced tool count
- **Memory usage**: Reduced memory footprint from removed tool code
- **Test execution**: Faster test suite execution due to removed test cases

### Maintenance Requirements
- **Code cleanliness**: No dead code or unused imports remaining after removal
- **Dependency hygiene**: No unused dependencies related to removed tool
- **Documentation currency**: All documentation stays current with removed tool status
- **Version compatibility**: Removal doesn't break compatibility with existing clients using other tools
