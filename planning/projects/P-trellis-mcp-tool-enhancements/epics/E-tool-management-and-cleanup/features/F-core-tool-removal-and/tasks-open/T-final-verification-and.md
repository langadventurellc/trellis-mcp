# Final Verification and Documentation of Tool Removal

## Purpose
Perform final comprehensive verification that the getNextReviewableTask tool has been completely removed from the system and document the successful completion of the tool removal process.

## Technical Context
This final task ensures that:
- All references to the removed tool have been eliminated
- System operates correctly without the tool
- No remnant files, imports, or references remain
- Tool removal is properly documented for future reference

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Comprehensive System Scan
Perform thorough search across entire codebase for any remaining references:
- Search for function names (getNextReviewableTask, get_next_reviewable_task)
- Search for file references (get_next_reviewable_task.py)
- Search for import statements and exports
- Check configuration files and documentation

### 2. Server Verification
Final verification of server functionality:
- Confirm server starts cleanly
- Verify tool listings show exactly 7 remaining tools
- Test server responds appropriately to removed tool requests
- Validate server performance and stability

### 3. Git Repository Cleanup
Ensure git repository is in clean state:
- Verify all changes are properly tracked
- Confirm no untracked files related to removal
- Check git history for proper deletion tracking
- Validate repository integrity

### 4. Documentation Updates
Update any documentation that referenced the removed tool:
- API documentation
- Tool listing documentation  
- User guides or examples
- Technical specifications

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Complete Reference Removal
- [ ] No occurrences of "getNextReviewableTask" in any source files
- [ ] No occurrences of "get_next_reviewable_task" in any source files
- [ ] No references to "get_oldest_review" or "is_reviewable" functions
- [ ] No broken imports or exports anywhere in codebase
- [ ] No remnant files (.pyc, __pycache__, backups) exist

### Server State Verification
- [ ] Server starts successfully without any warnings or errors
- [ ] Tool discovery returns exactly 7 tools (excluding getNextReviewableTask)
- [ ] Server responds with appropriate error for removed tool access attempts
- [ ] All remaining tools function correctly and completely
- [ ] Server info resource shows accurate information

### Git Repository Status
- [ ] `git status` shows clean working directory
- [ ] All tool removal changes properly committed
- [ ] Deleted files show as deleted in git history
- [ ] No untracked files related to tool removal
- [ ] Repository passes integrity checks

### Documentation Accuracy
- [ ] Tool listing documentation updated (if any exists)
- [ ] API documentation reflects removed tool (if any exists)
- [ ] No broken references to removed functionality in docs
- [ ] Examples or tutorials updated to exclude removed tool

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] All linting passes: `uv run flake8`
- [ ] All type checking passes: `uv run pyright`
- [ ] Code formatting correct: `uv run black --check`
- [ ] Full quality gate passes: `uv run poe quality`

## Implementation Steps

1. **Comprehensive search**: Use grep/rg to find any remaining references
2. **Server verification**: Test complete server functionality
3. **Git status check**: Verify repository cleanliness
4. **Documentation scan**: Check docs for broken references
5. **Quality gate execution**: Run all code quality checks
6. **Performance validation**: Verify no performance regressions
7. **Final testing**: Execute integration test scenarios
8. **Documentation completion**: Update task logs and completion records

## Dependencies and Prerequisites
- **Prerequisite**: T-system-integration-testing-after must be completed first
- All previous removal tasks must be successfully completed
- Access to complete codebase for verification scanning
- This is the final task in the removal sequence

## Security Considerations
- Verify no security holes introduced by tool removal
- Ensure audit logs show complete removal process
- Confirm no sensitive information exposed during removal
- Validate that security controls remain intact

## Performance Validation
- Server startup time should be equal or better than before removal
- Memory usage should be reduced appropriately
- Tool discovery should be faster with fewer tools
- No performance regressions in remaining functionality

## Error Scenarios and Recovery
- If references found: Update removal tasks to address missed items
- If server issues detected: Investigate root cause and fix
- If git problems: Clean up repository state appropriately
- If documentation issues: Update docs to reflect current state

## Comprehensive Search Commands
```bash
# Search for any remaining references (case insensitive)
rg -i "getnextreviewabletask|get_next_reviewable_task|get_oldest_review|is_reviewable" src/ tests/ docs/ || echo "No references found"

# Search for import statements
rg "from.*get_next_reviewable_task|import.*get_next_reviewable_task" src/ tests/ || echo "No imports found"

# Search for file references
find . -name "*get_next_reviewable_task*" -type f || echo "No files found"

# Check for broken imports
python3 -c "
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'src')
try:
    import trellis_mcp.server
    import trellis_mcp.tools
    import trellis_mcp.query
    print('All core modules import successfully')
except Exception as e:
    print(f'Import error: {e}')
"
```

## Server Verification Commands
```bash
# Test server startup and tool listing
timeout 10s uv run trellis-mcp serve --help

# Run complete quality gate
uv run poe quality

# Check git status
git status --porcelain

# Verify server can start in both modes
timeout 5s uv run trellis-mcp serve 2>&1 | head -n 5
timeout 5s uv run trellis-mcp serve --http localhost:8000 2>&1 | head -n 5
```

## Success Criteria
- Zero references to removed tool found in codebase
- Server operates perfectly with 7 remaining tools
- Git repository in clean, consistent state
- All quality checks pass without errors
- Documentation accurately reflects current state
- Performance metrics meet or exceed pre-removal baselines

## Completion Documentation
Record in task completion log:
- Comprehensive search results (should show zero matches)
- Server verification results (should show perfect operation)
- Git repository status (should be clean)
- Quality gate results (should pass completely)
- Performance impact summary
- Any lessons learned or recommendations

## Tool Removal Summary
Upon successful completion, the following should be true:
- Tool file `/src/trellis_mcp/tools/get_next_reviewable_task.py` deleted
- Server registration removed from `server.py`
- Module exports cleaned from `tools/__init__.py`
- Dependency functions removed from `query.py`
- All tests updated appropriately
- System verified to work correctly with 7 remaining tools
- Documentation reflects current state accurately
