## Context

With scope-based task filtering implemented across the tool interface, core logic, and scanner components, we need comprehensive integration tests to ensure the complete workflow functions correctly across different scope scenarios and edge cases.

## Implementation Requirements

### Create integration test suite
- Create `tests/integration/test_scope_claiming_workflow.py` for end-to-end testing
- Test complete workflow from tool interface through core logic to task scanning
- Cover all scope types (Project, Epic, Feature) with realistic test data

### Test scenario coverage
```python
class TestScopeClaimingWorkflow:
    """Integration tests for scope-based task claiming."""
    
    def test_project_scope_claiming(self):
        """Test claiming tasks within project scope boundaries."""
        
    def test_epic_scope_claiming(self):
        """Test claiming tasks within epic scope boundaries."""
        
    def test_feature_scope_claiming(self):
        """Test claiming tasks within feature scope boundaries."""
        
    def test_scope_with_prerequisites(self):
        """Test claiming with prerequisites across scope boundaries."""
        
    def test_empty_scope_handling(self):
        """Test graceful handling when scope contains no eligible tasks."""
```

### Cross-system compatibility testing
- Test scope filtering with mixed hierarchical/standalone task environments
- Verify standalone tasks are unaffected by scope filtering
- Test scope boundaries don't interfere with cross-system prerequisite validation

### Error condition testing
- Invalid scope IDs (malformed, non-existent objects)
- Scope objects that exist but contain no tasks
- Scope filtering with all tasks having incomplete prerequisites
- Integration error propagation from scanner through core to tool

### Performance validation
- Test scope filtering performance with large task hierarchies
- Verify no regression in claiming performance for non-scoped claims
- Validate memory efficiency with scope-filtered task iteration

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Complete workflow testing for all scope types (P-, E-, F-)
- [ ] Cross-system compatibility verified with mixed task environments
- [ ] Error handling tested across all integration points
- [ ] Performance validated for both scoped and non-scoped claiming
- [ ] Edge cases covered (empty scopes, invalid prerequisites)
- [ ] Backward compatibility confirmed for existing claiming behavior

## Testing Requirements

### Test data setup
- Create realistic project hierarchy with multiple epics and features
- Include tasks with various priorities and prerequisite relationships
- Mix of hierarchical and standalone tasks for cross-system testing

### Performance benchmarks
- Baseline claiming performance without scope filtering
- Scope filtering performance compared to full task scanning
- Memory usage validation for large hierarchies

### Error scenario validation
- Verify specific error messages for different failure modes
- Test error propagation maintains stack trace information
- Confirm graceful degradation in edge cases

## Dependencies

- Requires T-enhance-core-claimnexttask-logic for complete implementation
- Uses all components from FilterParams, scanner, and tool interface

## Files to Create

- `tests/integration/test_scope_claiming_workflow.py`: Complete integration test suite
- `tests/fixtures/scope_test_data.py`: Realistic test data for scope scenarios
