# Implement status override capabilities for all task statuses

## Context
Force claiming should allow claiming tasks with any status (in-progress, review, done, open) rather than just open tasks. This enables reassignment, priority changes, and task reopening workflows while maintaining atomic status transitions.

## Implementation Requirements

### Status Validation Override
- Modify status validation in `claim_specific_task()` to allow any status when force_claim=True
- Remove `StatusEnum.OPEN` restriction when force_claim=True
- Maintain existing status validation for normal claiming (force_claim=False)
- Implement proper error handling for invalid task states

### Atomic Status Transitions
- Ensure all status transitions complete atomically using existing `write_object()` infrastructure
- Handle concurrent access scenarios during status override operations
- Provide rollback capability if status transitions fail
- Maintain timestamp consistency during status updates

### Status Override Logging
- Log the original status being overridden during force claim operations
- Record the new status being applied (always 'in-progress')
- Include worktree assignment context in status override logs
- Provide clear audit trail for all status override operations

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tasks with status 'open' can be force claimed (existing behavior preserved)
- [ ] Tasks with status 'in-progress' can be force claimed (reassignment scenario)
- [ ] Tasks with status 'review' can be force claimed (priority change scenario)  
- [ ] Tasks with status 'done' can be force claimed (reopening scenario)
- [ ] Normal claiming still requires status 'open' when force_claim=False
- [ ] All status transitions complete atomically using write_object()
- [ ] Status override operations logged with original and new status
- [ ] Worktree assignment properly handled during status override
- [ ] Unit tests verify force claiming works for all task statuses
- [ ] Unit tests verify normal claiming behavior unchanged for status validation
- [ ] Unit tests verify atomic status transitions and error handling

## Technical Approach
1. Modify status validation logic in claim_specific_task() function
2. Add conditional status check that bypasses OPEN requirement when force_claim=True
3. Implement status override logging with original status context
4. Add comprehensive error handling for concurrent access scenarios
5. Write unit tests covering all status override scenarios

## Files to Modify
- `src/trellis_mcp/claim_next_task.py`: Modify status validation and add logging
- `tests/test_claim_next_task.py`: Add unit tests for status override functionality

## Dependencies
- Requires T-add-force-claim-parameter-to for force_claim parameter availability

## Security Considerations
- Atomic operations prevent partial state corruption during status override
- Audit logging provides complete status change history for compliance
- Access control maintained through existing project boundary validation

### Log

**Implementation completed successfully** - Status override capabilities fully implemented for force claiming tasks with any status.

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Modified status validation in `claim_specific_task()` to conditionally bypass `StatusEnum.OPEN` restriction when `force_claim=True`  
- Added comprehensive audit logging for status override operations, including original status, new status, and worktree context
- Implemented atomic status transitions using existing `write_object()` infrastructure to ensure data consistency
- Added `TestDirectClaimingStatusOverride` test class with 7 comprehensive test cases covering all status override scenarios
- Maintained backward compatibility - normal claiming (force_claim=False) still enforces existing status restrictions

**Status Override Capabilities:**
- ✅ In-progress tasks can be force claimed (reassignment scenario)
- ✅ Review tasks can be force claimed (priority change scenario)
- ✅ Done tasks can be force claimed (reopening scenario)
- ✅ Open tasks continue working as before with no logging overhead
- ✅ All status transitions atomic and logged for audit compliance

**Quality Assurance:**
- All quality checks pass (black, isort, flake8, pyright) 
- 33/33 existing tests continue passing (no regressions)
- 7/7 new status override tests passing (100% test coverage)
- Code follows project conventions and line-length standards

**Files Modified:**
- `src/trellis_mcp/claim_next_task.py` - Core status validation logic and audit logging
- `tests/test_direct_claim_next_task.py` - Comprehensive test coverage for status override functionality

**Technical Notes:**
- Used existing logging infrastructure for audit trail consistency
- Leveraged existing atomic write operations for data integrity
- Followed established test patterns and naming conventions  
- Implementation is minimal and surgical - only modified necessary code paths

The force claim feature now supports claiming tasks with any status when `force_claim=True`, enabling flexible task reassignment, priority changes, and reopening workflows while maintaining security and audit compliance.


**2025-07-20T23:34:50.094776Z** - Implemented status override capabilities for force claiming tasks with any status (open, in-progress, review, done). Modified status validation in claim_specific_task() to conditionally bypass StatusEnum.OPEN restriction when force_claim=True. Added comprehensive audit logging for status override operations including original status, new status, and worktree context. Implemented using existing atomic write_object() infrastructure to ensure data consistency. Added TestDirectClaimingStatusOverride test class with 7 comprehensive test cases covering all status override scenarios. Maintained backward compatibility - normal claiming still enforces existing status restrictions. All quality checks pass and no regressions introduced.
