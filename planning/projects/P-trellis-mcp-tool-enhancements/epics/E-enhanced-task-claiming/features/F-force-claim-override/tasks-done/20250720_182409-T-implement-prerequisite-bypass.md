# Implement prerequisite bypass logic for force claiming

## Context
When force_claim=True, the claiming process should skip prerequisite validation to allow claiming tasks even when dependencies are incomplete. This requires modifying the core claiming logic while maintaining data integrity.

## Implementation Requirements

### Core Bypass Logic
- Modify `claim_specific_task()` in `src/trellis_mcp/claim_next_task.py` to accept force_claim parameter
- Skip `is_unblocked()` prerequisite validation when force_claim=True
- Maintain atomic task status updates even when bypassing prerequisites
- Preserve all existing validation for normal claiming workflow

### Data Integrity Protection
- Ensure task dependency graph integrity remains intact
- Maintain task state consistency after force claim operations
- Preserve rollback capability if force claim operations fail

### Warning and Audit System
- Log warnings when bypassing incomplete prerequisites
- Record which prerequisites were incomplete during force claim
- Provide context for audit trail and debugging purposes

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] claim_specific_task() accepts force_claim parameter with proper type annotation
- [ ] Prerequisite validation completely bypassed when force_claim=True
- [ ] Normal prerequisite validation preserved when force_claim=False
- [ ] Task dependency graph integrity maintained after force claim operations
- [ ] Warning logs generated when bypassing incomplete prerequisites
- [ ] Audit context includes details about bypassed prerequisites
- [ ] Unit tests verify prerequisite bypass functionality works correctly
- [ ] Unit tests verify normal claiming behavior unchanged when force_claim=False
- [ ] Unit tests verify data integrity maintained during force claim operations

## Technical Approach
1. Add force_claim parameter to claim_specific_task() function signature
2. Add conditional logic to skip is_unblocked() call when force_claim=True
3. Implement logging for bypassed prerequisites with warning level
4. Add audit context capture for incomplete prerequisites
5. Write comprehensive unit tests covering both bypass and normal scenarios

## Files to Modify
- `src/trellis_mcp/claim_next_task.py`: Add force_claim logic and prerequisite bypass
- `tests/test_claim_next_task.py`: Add unit tests for prerequisite bypass functionality

## Dependencies
- Requires T-add-force-claim-parameter-to for force_claim parameter availability

## Security Considerations
- Access control boundaries maintained through existing projectRoot validation
- Audit trail provides accountability for administrative prerequisite bypass
- Data integrity constraints preserved even when bypassing business rules

### Log


**2025-07-20T23:24:09.917755Z** - Successfully implemented prerequisite bypass logic for force claiming in the Trellis MCP system. The core implementation was already complete with proper force_claim parameter handling, prerequisite validation bypass, and comprehensive warning/audit logging. Fixed failing unit tests by updating test assertions to include the force_claim parameter in mock calls. All 50 tests now pass, and all quality checks (black, isort, flake8, pyright) passed successfully. The force_claim functionality allows claiming tasks with incomplete prerequisites when force_claim=True is specified with a task_id, providing both flexibility for emergency scenarios and maintaining audit trail integrity.
