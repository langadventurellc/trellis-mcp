# Write integration tests for complete force claim workflows

## Context
Integration tests are needed to verify the complete force claim functionality works end-to-end across all components. These tests should cover the full workflow from tool interface through core logic, testing real-world scenarios. Do not do any kind of performance testing.

## Implementation Requirements

### End-to-End Force Claim Testing
- Test complete force claim workflow from claimNextTask tool to task file updates
- Verify force claim with all task statuses (open, in-progress, review, done)
- Test force claim with incomplete prerequisites and verify bypass
- Validate force claim parameter validation and error handling

### Cross-System Integration Testing
- Test force claiming of hierarchical tasks (within project/epic/feature structure)
- Test force claiming of standalone tasks
- Verify cross-system prerequisite bypass functionality
- Test interaction with existing normal claiming workflows

### Concurrent Access Testing
- Test concurrent force claim attempts on the same task
- Verify atomic operations prevent data corruption
- Test force claim during normal claiming operations
- Validate proper error handling for race conditions

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Integration tests cover force claiming from tool interface to file system
- [ ] Tests verify force claim works with all task statuses and prerequisite states
- [ ] Tests validate cross-system force claiming (hierarchical and standalone tasks)
- [ ] Tests verify parameter validation prevents misuse of force claim functionality
- [ ] Tests confirm concurrent force claim attempts handled gracefully
- [ ] Tests verify integration with existing normal claiming workflows
- [ ] Tests confirm atomic operations prevent data corruption
- [ ] Integration tests run successfully in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Test coverage includes error scenarios and edge cases
- [ ] Tests verify rollback capabilities for failed force claim operations

## Technical Approach
1. Create comprehensive integration test suite in `tests/integration/test_force_claim.py`
2. Set up test scenarios with hierarchical and standalone task structures
3. Test all force claim parameter combinations and validation scenarios
5. Add concurrent access testing with threading or async patterns

## Files to Create/Modify
- `tests/integration/test_force_claim.py`: Comprehensive integration test suite
- `tests/integration/conftest.py`: Test fixtures for force claim scenarios (if needed)

## Security Considerations
- Tests verify access control boundaries maintained during force operations
- Tests confirm no privilege escalation through force claim functionality
