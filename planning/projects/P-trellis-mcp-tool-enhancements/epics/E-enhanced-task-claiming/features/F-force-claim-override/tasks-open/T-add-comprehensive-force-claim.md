# Add comprehensive force claim audit logging

## Context
Force claim operations require comprehensive audit logging for security, compliance, and debugging purposes. This includes logging force claim attempts, prerequisite bypasses, status overrides, and operational context using the existing logging infrastructure.

## Implementation Requirements

### Force Claim Operation Logging
- Log all force claim attempts with task_id, worktree, and timestamp
- Record successful and failed force claim operations separately  
- Include context about what restrictions were bypassed (prerequisites, status)
- Use existing `write_event()` logging infrastructure from `src/trellis_mcp/logging/logger.py`

### Prerequisite Bypass Audit
- Log which specific prerequisites were incomplete during bypass
- Record prerequisite task IDs and their current status
- Include warning level logs for prerequisite bypass operations
- Provide sufficient context for security and compliance reviews

### Status Override Audit
- Log original task status being overridden
- Record new status being applied (in-progress)
- Include worktree assignment details in status override logs
- Track timestamp and user context for status changes

### Operational Context
- Record project_root context for access boundary validation
- Include task metadata (parent feature/epic, priority) in logs
- Log any error conditions or rollback operations
- Maintain immutable audit trail for forensic analysis

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Force claim attempts logged with complete operational context
- [ ] Prerequisite bypass operations logged with incomplete prerequisite details
- [ ] Status override operations logged with original and new status
- [ ] All logs use existing write_event() infrastructure and JSONL format
- [ ] Warning level logs generated for prerequisite bypass operations
- [ ] Info level logs generated for successful force claim operations
- [ ] Error level logs generated for failed force claim operations
- [ ] Audit logs include sufficient context for security reviews
- [ ] Unit tests verify all logging operations work correctly
- [ ] Unit tests verify log format matches existing logging schema
- [ ] Unit tests verify appropriate log levels used for different operations

## Technical Approach
1. Import and use existing logging infrastructure from `src/trellis_mcp/logging/logger.py`
2. Add force claim specific logging functions with proper log levels
3. Integrate logging calls into prerequisite bypass and status override logic
4. Include comprehensive context in all audit log entries
5. Write unit tests to verify logging behavior and format

## Files to Modify
- `src/trellis_mcp/claim_next_task.py`: Add audit logging calls throughout force claim logic
- `tests/test_claim_next_task.py`: Add unit tests for audit logging functionality

## Dependencies
- Requires T-implement-prerequisite-bypass for prerequisite bypass logging integration
- Requires T-implement-status-override for status override logging integration

## Security Considerations
- Immutable audit trail provides accountability for administrative actions
- Complete context capture supports security and compliance requirements
- Log format consistent with existing security logging standards
