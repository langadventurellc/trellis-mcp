Old instructions:
Consolidate the 5 mixed task test files (test_mixed_dependency_chain_integration.py, test_mixed_task_lifecycle.py, test_mixed_task_operations.py, test_mixed_task_path_resolution.py, test_mixed_task_validation.py) into 2 files: test_mixed_task_core.py and test_mixed_task_integration.py.

New instructions:
Instead of merging the 5 mixed task test files, analyze each file to identify and remove redundant test scenarios. Keep the files separate for maintainability but eliminate overlapping test logic. Focus on removing duplicate validation, workflow, and operation tests while preserving unique edge cases.

### Log


**2025-07-19T13:35:47.639404Z** - Successfully removed redundant test scenarios from 5 mixed task test files while preserving unique edge cases and maintaining file separation. Eliminated overlapping test logic across basic CRUD operations, performance benchmarks, and error handling patterns. Consolidated performance testing in operations.py and focused each file on its core purpose: dependency chains (integration.py), workflows (lifecycle.py), CRUD operations and performance (operations.py), path resolution (path_resolution.py), and validation (validation.py). All tests pass and code is clean.
