After completing all test consolidation tasks, update any references to old test file names in documentation, CI configuration, and development scripts. Verify that all tests still pass and update the test inventory document with the final results and metrics.

See `test-inventory.md` for details on existing error handling tests.

### Log


**2025-07-19T16:22:01.880782Z** - Updated test documentation and verified CI configuration after test consolidation work. Updated test-inventory.md with final consolidation results showing 10.7% file reduction (84→75 files) and 8.5% line reduction (47,228→43,208 lines). Verified CI configuration uses generic pytest commands without hardcoded test file references. Confirmed all 1,520 tests passing and all quality checks pass. No documentation updates needed as main docs don't reference specific test files.
