Merge task-related test files that have overlapping functionality: combine test_task_sort_key.py + test_task_sorter.py into test_task_sorting.py, and merge test_complete_task.py + test_complete_task_file_movement.py into test_task_completion.py. Ensure all sorting and completion logic is thoroughly tested.

### Log


**2025-07-19T14:33:10.496563Z** - Successfully consolidated task management test files from 4 files to 2 files, reducing redundancy while preserving all test functionality. Merged test_task_sort_key.py and test_task_sorter.py into test_task_sorting.py with both TestTaskSortKey and TestSortTasksByPriority classes. Merged test_complete_task.py and test_complete_task_file_movement.py into test_task_completion.py preserving all unit tests (with mocks) and integration tests (with real filesystem). Eliminated duplicate create_test_task helper functions and added comprehensive module documentation. All 1554 tests pass and quality checks (format, lint, type check) are clean.
