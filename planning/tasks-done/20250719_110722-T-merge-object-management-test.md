Consolidate object-related test files: merge test_object_parser.py + test_object_roundtrip.py into test_object_operations.py. Review test_object_creation_and_ids.py integration tests for overlap with unit test coverage and remove redundancies while keeping integration-specific test cases.

See `test-inventory.md` for details on existing error handling tests.

### Log


**2025-07-19T16:07:22.948779Z** - Successfully consolidated object management test files by merging test_object_parser.py and test_object_roundtrip.py into a new test_object_operations.py file. The consolidation eliminated redundancy while preserving all unique functionality including YAML parsing error handling, Pydantic validation testing, round-trip data integrity verification, and specialized standalone task serialization behavior. The integration test file test_object_creation_and_ids.py was preserved unchanged as it provides distinct server integration testing that complements the unit tests. All 36 consolidated tests pass and quality checks are clean.
