The test_server.py file is 34,229 tokens, making it extremely difficult to maintain. Split this file into logical modules: server core tests, CRUD operation tests, validation tests, and integration workflow tests. Ensure all tests still pass after the split.

### Log


**2025-07-19T05:01:05.639249Z** - Successfully split the oversized test_server.py file (3,942 lines, 34,229 tokens) into 4 logical modules based on functionality. Created test_server_core.py (server creation tests), test_server_transport.py (HTTP transport tests), test_server_crud.py (CRUD operation tests), and test_server_workflows.py (workflow and integration tests). All 129 tests pass after the split, imports were cleaned up, and quality checks pass. The original file has been removed.
