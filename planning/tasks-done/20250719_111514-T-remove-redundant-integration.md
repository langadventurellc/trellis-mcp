Review integration tests that duplicate unit test coverage and remove redundancies. Focus on test_integration_task_lifecycle_workflow.py vs individual unit tests, test_dependency_management.py vs test_dependency_resolver.py, and test_integration_schema_loading.py vs loader unit tests. Keep only tests that add integration-specific value.

See `test-inventory.md` for details on existing error handling tests.

### Log


**2025-07-19T16:15:14.302184Z** - Successfully removed 2 redundant integration test files that duplicated unit test coverage. Eliminated test_integration_task_lifecycle_workflow.py (248 lines) which was fully covered by unit tests for task claiming, completion, and file movement. Also removed test_dependency_management.py (166 lines) which duplicated dependency resolution functionality already tested in test_dependency_resolver.py. Kept test_integration_schema_loading.py as it provides unique object loading validation not covered by configuration loader unit tests. All quality checks and remaining tests pass, confirming no regressions introduced. This reduces test maintenance overhead while maintaining full coverage.
