# Cross-System Prerequisites Documentation

This documentation provides comprehensive guidance for managing prerequisites that span across different systems and components in Trellis MCP.

## Overview

Cross-system prerequisites enable complex dependency management where tasks, features, or epics may depend on components from different projects, external services, or system resources. This documentation covers the architecture, implementation patterns, and best practices for effective cross-system integration.

## Documentation Sections

### ðŸ“‹ **[Architecture](./architecture.md)**
System design and component relationships for cross-system prerequisites, including dependency resolution algorithms and validation patterns.

### ðŸ“š **[Examples](./examples/)**
Practical examples and implementation patterns for common cross-system prerequisite scenarios, with code samples and configuration examples.

### ðŸ”§ **[Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md)**
Common issues, diagnostic procedures, and solutions for cross-system prerequisite problems, including debugging techniques and error resolution.

### âš¡ **[Performance](./performance.md)**
Performance guidelines, optimization strategies, and benchmarking for cross-system prerequisite operations, including caching and validation efficiency.

## Quick Reference

### Key Concepts

- **Cross-System Dependencies**: Prerequisites that reference external systems or projects
- **Validation Scope**: How prerequisite validation handles external dependencies
- **Resolution Strategy**: Methods for resolving and verifying cross-system prerequisites

### Common Use Cases

1. **Multi-Project Dependencies**: Tasks depending on components from other projects
2. **External Service Integration**: Prerequisites requiring external service availability
3. **Infrastructure Dependencies**: Tasks requiring specific system resources or configurations
4. **Version Compatibility**: Managing dependencies across different system versions

### Getting Started

1. Read the [Architecture](./architecture.md) overview
2. Review [Examples](./examples/) for your use case
3. Implement following performance [guidelines](./performance.md)
4. Use [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md) if issues arise

## Integration with Trellis MCP

Cross-system prerequisites extend the standard Trellis MCP prerequisite system with:

- Enhanced validation for external dependencies
- Flexible resolution strategies for different system types
- Performance optimizations for complex dependency graphs
- Comprehensive error handling and reporting

For general prerequisite documentation, see the main Trellis MCP specification.
