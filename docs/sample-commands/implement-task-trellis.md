# Implement Task Command

Claim and implement the next available task from the backlog using the Trellis task management system with the Research ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Implement workflow.

## Trellis System Overview

The Trellis task management system organizes work in a hierarchical structure:

- **Projects**: Large-scale initiatives or products (e.g., "E-commerce Platform Redesign")
- **Epics**: Major work streams within a project (e.g., "User Authentication", "Payment Processing")
- **Features**: Specific functionality within epics (e.g., "Login Form", "Password Reset")
- **Tasks**: Atomic units of work, 1-2 hours each (e.g., "Create user model", "Add email validation")

This hierarchy enables parallel development, clear dependencies, and manageable work units.

## Goal

Automatically claim the highest-priority available task and implement it following project standards, with comprehensive research, planning, and quality checks before marking complete.

## Process

### 1. Claim Next Available Task

#### Input

`$ARGUMENTS` (optional) - Can specify:
- Specific task ID to claim (e.g., "T-create-user-model")
- Worktree path if using git worktrees
- Additional context or preferences

#### Instructions

If no specific task provided, use MCP `claimNextTask` to get the highest-priority available task.
If specific task ID provided, use MCP `getObject` and `updateObject` to claim it.

**Task claimed successfully:**
```
‚úÖ Claimed task: T-create-user-model

üìã Task Details:
- Title: Create user database model with required fields
- Parent: F-user-registration
- Priority: High
- Status: Now in-progress

Let me research and plan before implementing...
```

**If no tasks available:**
```
‚ùå No available tasks found!

This could mean:
- All tasks are already claimed or completed
- All open tasks have incomplete prerequisites
- No tasks exist in the project

Check the backlog status or create new tasks for a feature.
```

### 2. Research Phase (MANDATORY)

**Never skip research - understand before coding:**

The research phase is critical for understanding the context and requirements before writing any code. During this phase:

- **Read parent objects for context**: Use MCP `getObject` to read the parent feature, epic, and project for additional context, specifications, and requirements that may not be fully detailed in the task description
- **Analyze project structure**: Explore the codebase to understand file organization, naming conventions, and architectural patterns
- **Study existing implementations**: Find similar code in the project to maintain consistency with established patterns
- **Research best practices**: Use the context7 MCP tool to access up-to-date documentation for libraries and frameworks
- **Use web search**: Search for current best practices, security considerations, and common pitfalls
- **Identify security requirements**: Consider authentication, authorization, input validation, and data protection needs
- **Review related code**: Examine interfaces this task will interact with to ensure compatibility
- **Check project documentation**: Look for CLAUDE.md, README files, or architecture docs for project-specific guidelines

```

‚úÖ Research complete. Creating implementation plan...
```

### 3. Plan Implementation

**Create detailed plan before coding:**

The planning phase translates research findings into a concrete implementation strategy. This phase should:

- **Define file structure**: Determine what files need to be created or modified
- **Sequence implementation steps**: Order tasks logically to avoid rework
- **Plan security measures**: Explicitly plan how to handle authentication, validation, and data protection
- **Design testing strategy**: Decide what tests are needed and how to structure them
- **Consider error handling**: Plan for edge cases and failure scenarios
- **Identify dependencies**: Note what needs to be imported or configured
- **Plan for maintainability**: Consider code organization, documentation, and future modifications

```
üìù Implementation Plan for T-create-user-model

1. File Structure:
   - models/User.js (model definition)
   - models/index.js (update barrel export)
   - migrations/001_create_users.sql

2. Implementation Steps:
   a) Create Prisma schema for User model
   b) Add field validations and constraints
   c) Generate migration files
   d) Create model wrapper with methods
   e) Write comprehensive tests
   f) Update documentation

3. Security Measures:
   - bcrypt for password hashing
   - Email regex validation
   - SQL injection prevention via ORM

4. Testing Strategy:
   - Unit tests for model methods
   - Validation edge cases
   - Unique constraint tests

Ready to implement with this plan.
```

### 4. Implementation Phase

**Execute the plan with progress updates:**

The implementation phase is where the actual coding happens. During this phase:

- **Follow the plan**: Execute the steps identified in the planning phase
- **Write clean code**: Follow project conventions and best practices
- **Implement incrementally**: Build and test small pieces before moving to the next
- **Run quality checks frequently**: Format, lint, and test after each major change
- **Write tests alongside code**: Don't leave testing for the end
- **Document as you go**: Add comments for complex logic or decisions
- **Apply security measures**: Implement validation, sanitization, and protection as planned
- **Handle errors gracefully**: Include proper error handling and user feedback

```

### 5. Complete Task

**Update task and provide summary:**

The completion phase ensures the task is properly documented and marked as done. This phase includes:

- **Verify all requirements met**: Check that the implementation satisfies the task description
- **Confirm quality checks pass**: Ensure all tests, linting, and formatting are clean
- **Write meaningful summary**: Describe what was implemented and any important decisions
- **List all changed files**: Document what was created or modified
- **Update task status**: Use MCP to mark the task as complete
- **Note any follow-up needed**: Identify if additional tasks should be created

Use MCP `completeTask` with:
- Task ID
- Summary of work done
- List of files changed

Example for a database model task:
```
‚úÖ Completing task: T-create-user-model

Summary:
Implemented User model with all required fields including secure password 
hashing, email validation, and unique constraints. Added comprehensive 
test coverage and database migrations. Password hashing uses bcrypt with 12

### 6. Next Steps

**Provide clear next actions:**

```
üéØ Task Complete: T-create-user-model

Next available task:
- T-add-user-validation: Add validation rules for user model
  (Depends on the task you just completed)

Run /implement-task again to claim and implement the next task.

Note: Your completed task has unblocked dependent tasks!
```

**STOP!** - Do not proceed. Complete one task and one task only. Do not implement another task.

## Error Handling

## Problem-Solving Framework

When you're stuck or confused:

1. **Stop** - Don't spiral into complex solutions
2. **Delegate** - Consider spawning agents for parallel investigation
3. **Think Deeply** - For complex problems, say "I need to think through this challenge"
4. **Step back** - Re-read the requirements and existing code
5. **Simplify** - The simple solution is usually correct
6. **Ask** - "I see two approaches: [A] vs [B]. Which do you prefer?"

When facing architectural decisions:

- Present options clearly with pros/cons
- Recommend the simpler approach
- Ask for guidance on trade-offs

### Use Multiple Agents

*Leverage subagents aggressively* for better results:

- Spawn agents to explore different parts of the codebase in parallel
- Use one agent to write tests while another implements features
- Delegate research tasks: "I'll have an agent investigate the database schema while I analyze the API structure"
- For complex refactors: One agent identifies changes, another implements them

Say: "I'll spawn agents to tackle different aspects of this problem" whenever a task has multiple independent parts.

### During Research Phase

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Research issue: Cannot find existing model patterns

Attempting alternative approaches:
- Checking documentation...
- Searching for examples...
- Using web search for best practices...

[If still stuck]
‚ùì Need clarification: 
The project doesn't seem to have existing models. 
Should I:
A) Create the first model and establish patterns
B) Check if models are in a different location
C) Use a different approach (raw SQL, different ORM)
```

### During Implementation

```
‚ùå Quality check failed: Linting errors found

models/User.js
  24:1  error  Multiple exports in file  one-export-per-file

üîß Fixing quality issues...
‚úì Split exports into separate files
‚úì Re-running quality checks...
‚úÖ All checks now passing!
```

### Blocked Tasks

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Cannot claim task: Prerequisites not met

Task T-api-tests requires:
- T-register-endpoint (in-progress)
- T-verify-endpoint (open)

These tasks must be completed first.
Searching for other available tasks...

‚úÖ Found alternative: T-registration-form (frontend task)
This can be worked on in parallel.
```

## Security & Performance Principles

### Security Always:

- **Validate ALL inputs** - Never trust user data
- **Use secure defaults** - Fail closed, not open
- **Parameterized queries** - Never concatenate SQL/queries
- **Secure random** - Use cryptographically secure generators
- **Least privilege** - Request minimum permissions needed
- **Error handling** - Don't expose internal details

### Measure First:

- **No premature optimization** - Don't optimize unless specifically requested
- **No over-engineering** - Build only what's needed for the task
- **No extra features** - Don't add functionality that wasn't requested
- **Keep it simple** - Choose the most straightforward approach that works
- **Solve the actual problem** - Don't anticipate future requirements

### Forbidden Patterns:

- **NO "any" types** - Use specific, concrete types
- **NO sleep/wait loops** - Use proper async patterns
- **NO keeping old and new code together** - Delete replaced code immediately
- **NO custom error hierarchies** - Keep errors simple
- **NO hardcoded secrets or environment values**
- **NO concatenating user input into queries** - Use parameterized queries

### Modular Code Architecture:

- **Clear boundaries** - Each module/class/function should have a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Minimal coupling** - Components should interact through clean interfaces, not internal implementation details
- **High cohesion** - Related functionality should be grouped together in the same module
- **Dependency injection** - Use interfaces and dependency injection instead of tight coupling
- **Avoid big ball of mud** - Prevent tangled cross-dependencies between modules
- **Clean interfaces** - Define clear contracts (APIs) between components
- **Separation of concerns** - Keep business logic, data access, and UI separate
- **Avoid circular dependencies** - Structure code to have clear dependency flow

## Quality Standards

During implementation, ensure:

- **Research First**: Never skip research phase
- **One Export Per File**: Enforced by linting
- **Test Coverage**: Write tests in same task
- **Security**: Validate all inputs
- **Documentation**: Comment complex logic
- **Quality Checks**: All must pass before completion

## Communication Standards

### Progress Updates:

```
‚úì Researched existing patterns
‚úì Implemented authentication (all tests passing)
‚úì Added input validation
‚úó Found issue with token expiration - investigating
```

### Quality Check Results:

```
‚úÖ Format: Clean
‚úÖ Lint: 0 errors, 0 warnings
‚úÖ Type Check: Pass
‚úÖ Tests: 42 passing, 0 failing
‚úÖ Build: Success
```
