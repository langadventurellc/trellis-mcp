# Create Features Command

Break down an epic into specific features using the Trellis task management system by analyzing the epic specification and gathering additional requirements as needed.

## Trellis System Overview

The Trellis task management system organizes work in a hierarchical structure:

- **Projects**: Large-scale initiatives or products (e.g., "E-commerce Platform Redesign")
- **Epics**: Major work streams within a project (e.g., "User Authentication", "Payment Processing")
- **Features**: Specific functionality within epics (e.g., "Login Form", "Password Reset")
- **Tasks**: Atomic units of work, 1-2 hours each (e.g., "Create user model", "Add email validation")

This hierarchy enables parallel development, clear dependencies, and manageable work units.

## Goal

Analyze an epic's comprehensive specification to create well-structured features that represent implementable functionality, ensuring complete coverage of the epic's scope and enabling effective task decomposition.

## Process

### 1. Identify Target Epic

#### Input

`$ARGUMENTS`

#### Epic Context

The epic ID may be:
- Provided in `input` (e.g., "E-user-auth")
- Known from previous conversation context
- Specified along with additional instructions in `input`

#### Instructions

Retrieve the epic using MCP `getObject` to access its comprehensive description, requirements, and parent project context.

### 2. Analyze Epic Specification

**Thoroughly analyze the epic description to identify natural feature boundaries:**

- **Use context7 MCP tool** to research technical approaches and best practices
- **Search codebase** for similar feature patterns or implementations
- Extract all deliverables and components from the epic description
- Review architecture diagrams and technical specifications
- Analyze user stories to identify discrete user-facing functionality
- Consider non-functional requirements that need specific implementation
- Group related functionality into cohesive features
- Identify dependencies between features
- Note any specific instructions provided in `input`

### 3. Gather Additional Information

**Ask clarifying questions as needed to refine the feature structure:**

Use this structured approach:
- **Ask one question at a time** with specific options
- **Focus on feature boundaries** - understand what constitutes a complete, testable feature
- **Identify component relationships** - how features interact with each other
- **Continue until complete** - don't stop until you have clear feature structure

Key areas to clarify:
- **Feature Boundaries**: What constitutes a complete, testable feature?
- **Dependencies**: Which features must be implemented before others?
- **Technical Approach**: How should complex functionality be divided?
- **Testing Strategy**: How can features be tested independently?
- **Integration Points**: Where do features interface with each other?

**Example questioning approach:**
```
How should the user registration feature be scoped?
Options:
- A) Basic registration only (email, password, confirmation)
- B) Full registration with profile setup and email verification
- C) Registration with social login integration included
```

Continue until the feature structure:
- Covers all aspects of the epic specification
- Represents 6-20 tasks worth of work per feature
- Has clear implementation boundaries
- Enables independent development and testing

### 4. Generate Feature Structure

For each feature, create:
- **Title**: Clear, specific name (3-5 words)
- **Description**: Comprehensive explanation including:
  - Purpose and functionality
  - Key components to implement
  - **Detailed Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, measurable requirements that define feature completion, including:
    - Functional behavior with specific input/output expectations
    - User interface requirements and interaction patterns
    - Data validation and error handling criteria
    - Integration points with other features or systems
    - Performance benchmarks and response time requirements
    - Security validation and access control requirements
    - Browser/platform compatibility requirements
    - Accessibility and usability standards
  - Technical requirements
  - Dependencies on other features
  - **Implementation Guidance** - Technical approach and patterns to follow
  - **Testing Requirements** - How to verify the feature works correctly
  - **Security Considerations** - Input validation, authorization, data protection needs
  - **Performance Requirements** - Response times, resource usage constraints

**Feature Granularity Guidelines:**

Each feature should be sized appropriately for task breakdown:
- **6-20 tasks per feature** - Features should represent enough work to be meaningful but not overwhelming
- **1-2 hours per task** - When broken down, each task should be completable in 1-2 hours
- **Independent implementation** - Features should be implementable without blocking other features
- **Testable boundaries** - Features should have clear success criteria and testing strategies

### 5. Create Features Using MCP

For each feature, call the Task Trellis MCP `createObject` tool:

- `projectRoot`: Current working directory
- `kind`: Set to `"feature"`
- `parent`: The epic ID
- `title`: Generated feature title
- `status`: Set to `"in-progress"` (not `"open"` or `"draft"` unless specified)
- `prerequisites`: List of feature IDs that must complete first
- `description`: Comprehensive feature description with all elements from step 4

### 6. Output Format

After successful creation:

```
âœ… Successfully created [N] features for epic "[Epic Title]"

ðŸ“‹ Created Features:
1. F-[id1]: [Feature 1 Title]
   â†’ Dependencies: none
   
2. F-[id2]: [Feature 2 Title]
   â†’ Dependencies: F-[id1]
   
3. F-[id3]: [Feature 3 Title]
   â†’ Dependencies: F-[id1], F-[id2]

ðŸ“Š Feature Summary:
- Total Features: [N]
- Dependencies Configured: âœ“

Next step:
Use /create-tasks to break down features into implementable tasks
```

## Example Feature Structures

   - Dependencies: Login System

4. Two-Factor Authentication

   - Dependencies: Login System

5. OAuth Integration

   - Entity definitions, relationships, validation
   - Dependencies: none

2. Database Migrations

## Simplicity Principles

When creating features, follow these guidelines:

### Keep It Simple:
- **No over-engineering** - Create only the features needed for the epic
- **No extra features** - Don't add functionality that wasn't requested
- **Choose straightforward approaches** - Simple feature structure over complex designs
- **Solve the actual problem** - Don't anticipate future requirements

### Forbidden Patterns:
- **NO premature optimization** - Don't optimize feature structure unless requested
- **NO feature creep** - Stick to the specified epic requirements
- **NO complex dependencies** - Keep feature relationships simple and clear
- **NO unnecessary abstractions** - Choose direct, maintainable approaches

### Modular Architecture:
- **Clear boundaries** - Each feature should have distinct, well-defined responsibilities
- **Minimal coupling** - Features should interact through clean interfaces, not internal dependencies
- **High cohesion** - Related functionality should be grouped within the same feature
- **Avoid big ball of mud** - Prevent tangled cross-dependencies between features
- **Clean interfaces** - Define clear contracts between features for data and functionality exchange

## Question Guidelines

Ask questions that:
- **Define feature scope**: What's included vs excluded?
- **Clarify technical approach**: Specific technologies or patterns?
- **Identify dependencies**: Build order and integration points?
- **Consider testing**: How to verify feature completeness?

## Error Handling

- **Epic not found**: Provide clear error message
- **Invalid dependencies**: Detect and prevent circular dependencies
- **Missing epic description**: Request epic details be added first
