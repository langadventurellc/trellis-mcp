# Create Epics Command

Break down a project into major epics using the Trellis task management system by analyzing the project specification and gathering additional requirements as needed.

## Trellis System Overview

The Trellis task management system organizes work in a hierarchical structure:

- **Projects**: Large-scale initiatives or products (e.g., "E-commerce Platform Redesign")
- **Epics**: Major work streams within a project (e.g., "User Authentication", "Payment Processing")
- **Features**: Specific functionality within epics (e.g., "Login Form", "Password Reset")
- **Tasks**: Atomic units of work, 1-2 hours each (e.g., "Create user model", "Add email validation")

This hierarchy enables parallel development, clear dependencies, and manageable work units.

## Goal

Analyze a project's comprehensive specification to create well-structured epics that represent major work streams, ensuring complete coverage of all project requirements and enabling effective feature decomposition.

## Process

### 1. Identify Target Project

#### Input

`$ARGUMENTS`

#### Project Context

The project ID may be:
- Provided in `input` (e.g., "P-inventory-mgmt")
- Known from previous conversation context
- Specified along with additional instructions in `input`

#### Instructions

Retrieve the project using MCP `getObject` to access its comprehensive description and requirements.

### 2. Analyze Project Specification

**Thoroughly analyze the project description to identify natural epic boundaries:**

- **Use context7 MCP tool** to research architectural patterns and best practices
- **Search codebase** for similar epic structures or patterns
- Extract all functional requirements from the project description
- Identify major technical components and systems
- Consider cross-cutting concerns (security, testing, deployment, monitoring)
- Group related functionality into cohesive work streams
- Identify dependencies between work streams
- Consider development phases and prerequisites
- Note any specific instructions provided in `input`

### 3. Gather Additional Information

**Ask clarifying questions as needed to refine the epic structure:**

Use this structured approach:
- **Ask one question at a time** with specific options
- **Focus on epic boundaries** - understand where one epic ends and another begins
- **Identify component relationships** - how epics interact with each other
- **Continue until complete** - don't stop until you have clear epic structure

Key areas to clarify:
- **Epic Boundaries**: Where does one epic end and another begin?
- **Dependencies**: Which epics must complete before others can start?
- **Technical Grouping**: Should technical concerns be separate epics or integrated?
- **Phases**: Should there be phase-based epics (MVP, Enhancement, etc.)?
- **Non-functional**: How to handle security, performance, monitoring as epics?

**Example questioning approach:**
```
How should the authentication system be organized as an epic?
Options:
- A) Separate epic for all authentication (login, registration, password reset)
- B) Integrate authentication into each functional epic
- C) Split into multiple epics (core auth, advanced features, integrations)
```

Continue until the epic structure:
- Covers all aspects of the project specification
- Has clear boundaries and scope
- Enables parallel development where possible
- Supports logical feature breakdown

### 4. Generate Epic Structure

For each epic, create:
- **Title**: Clear, descriptive name (3-5 words)
- **Description**: Comprehensive explanation including:
  - Purpose and goals
  - Major components and deliverables
  - Success criteria
  - Technical considerations
  - Dependencies on other epics
  - Estimated scale (number of features)
  - **Architecture Diagrams** (where applicable) - System design, data flow, component relationships in Mermaid
  - **User Stories** - Key user scenarios this epic addresses
  - **Non-functional Requirements** - Performance, security, scalability considerations specific to this epic

**Architecture Diagram Guidelines:**

Include Mermaid diagrams when they add value for:
- **Epic Architecture**: Components and interactions within the epic
- **Data Flow**: How information moves through the epic's components
- **Integration Points**: How this epic connects to other epics or external systems
- **Sequence Diagrams**: Complex processes or workflows within the epic

### 5. Create Epics Using MCP

For each epic, call the Task Trellis MCP `createObject` tool:

- `projectRoot`: Current working directory
- `kind`: Set to `"epic"`
- `parent`: The project ID
- `title`: Generated epic title
- `status`: Set to `"in-progress"` (not `"open"` or `"draft"` unless specified)
- `prerequisites`: List of epic IDs that must complete first
- `description`: Comprehensive epic description with all elements from step 4

### 6. Output Format

After successful creation:

```
âœ… Successfully created [N] epics for project "[Project Title]"

ðŸ“‹ Created Epics:
1. E-[id1]: [Epic 1 Title]
   â†’ Dependencies: none
   
2. E-[id2]: [Epic 2 Title]
   â†’ Dependencies: E-[id1]
   
3. E-[id3]: [Epic 3 Title]
   â†’ Dependencies: E-[id1], E-[id2]

ðŸ“Š Epic Summary:
- Total Epics: [N]
- Dependencies Configured: âœ“

Next step:
Use /create-features to break down each epic into implementable features.
```

## Simplicity Principles

When creating epics, follow these guidelines:

### Keep It Simple:
- **No over-engineering** - Create only the epics needed for the project
- **No extra features** - Don't add functionality that wasn't requested
- **Choose straightforward approaches** - Simple epic structure over complex hierarchies
- **Solve the actual problem** - Don't anticipate future requirements

### Forbidden Patterns:
- **NO premature optimization** - Don't optimize epic structure unless requested
- **NO feature creep** - Stick to the specified project requirements
- **NO complex dependencies** - Keep epic relationships simple and clear
- **NO unnecessary technical debt** - Choose maintainable approaches

### Modular Architecture:
- **Clear boundaries** - Each epic should have distinct, well-defined responsibilities
- **Minimal coupling** - Epics should interact through clean interfaces, not internal dependencies
- **High cohesion** - Related functionality should be grouped within the same epic
- **Avoid big ball of mud** - Prevent tangled cross-dependencies between epics
- **Clean interfaces** - Define clear contracts between epics for data and functionality exchange

## Question Guidelines

Ask questions that:
- **Clarify epic boundaries**: What functionality belongs together?
- **Identify dependencies**: What must be built first?
- **Consider team structure**: Can epics be worked on in parallel?
- **Plan for phases**: MVP vs full implementation?
- **Address non-functionals**: Where do performance/security requirements fit?

## Error Handling

- **Project not found**: Provide clear error message
- **Invalid dependencies**: Detect and prevent circular dependencies
- **Missing project description**: Request project details be added first
