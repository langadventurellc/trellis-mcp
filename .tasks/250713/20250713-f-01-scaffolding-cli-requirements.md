# Feature

Establish the foundational scaffolding and command-line interface for the Trellis MCP server implementation.

## Requirements:

- Setup `uv` for Python package management (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- Add development tooling integration (pre-commit, flake8, black, pyright, pytest, poethepoet, pyla-linter (flake8 plugin), pyla-logger (custom logger))
  - See `~/code/vault-api/pyproject.toml` for reference (except use `uv` instead of `poetry`)
- Set up Python 3.12 project structure with proper package organization, including `.gitignore`
- Configure FastMCP framework as the JSON-RPC server foundation (https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/installation)
- Implement basic CLI entry point for starting the MCP server
- Create configuration management system for server settings
- Establish file-based storage structure for Trellis MCP v1.0 hierarchy (Projects → Epics → Features → Tasks)
- Create basic logging and error handling framework
- Implement server lifecycle management (start, stop, graceful shutdown)
- Add health check endpoint for server monitoring
- Configure packaging and distribution setup (setup.py/pyproject.toml)
- Establish testing framework structure for unit and integration tests
